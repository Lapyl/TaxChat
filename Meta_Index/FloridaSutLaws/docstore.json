Any tax authorized pursuant to this section shall be administered and collected exclusively as provided herein and may consist of one or more component levies as enumerated in subsection (4). It is the legislative intent that any authorization for imposition of a convention development tax shall be published in the Florida Statutes as a paragraph of subsection (4), irrespective of the duration of the levy. Each enactment shall specify the types of local governments authorized to levy a convention development tax; the rate or rates which may be imposed; the maximum length of time the tax may be imposed, if any; the procedure which must be followed to secure voter approval, if required; the purpose for which the proceeds may be expended; and such other requirements as the Legislature may provide. One of the principal purposes of the convention development tax is to promote tourism and the use of hotel facilities by facilitating the improvement and construction of convention centers. Any municipality or county wherein the convention development tax is levied is specifically authorized to adopt and implement a convention center booking policy to apply to convention centers owned or operated by a municipality or county which gives priority to bookings after July 1, 1993, in accordance with the minimum number of hotel rooms to be utilized in connection with such convention center bookings or in accordance with the impact of such bookings on the convention development tax generated.\n(3)\u2003APPLICATION; ADMINISTRATION;", "start_char_idx": 40611, "end_char_idx": 44211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "504327d4-95ee-4323-be44-584d03087e5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "504327d4-95ee-4323-be44-584d03087e5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "95a0db74-4b04-496d-b767-5b84008628ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8595dc719e3a49eeb5a0efcdaa85e456884476b8e39428c30278e56706ef583"}, "3": {"node_id": "600ed2e4-83e5-459d-acf1-48ed8001765e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "60679b033a0c37119dad23c6b82030ccdbdc185ddeb67928ea0b62460fcf9d80"}}, "hash": "88d9c4548d8a0dbd082c9c43724b43a5475e67df16588375be6e07832fe0b046", "text": "development tax generated.\n(3)\u2003APPLICATION; ADMINISTRATION; PENALTIES.\u2014\n(a)1.\u2003The convention development tax on transient rentals imposed by the governing body of any county authorized to so levy shall apply to the amount of any payment made by any person to rent, lease, or use for a period of 6 months or less any living quarters or accommodations in a hotel, apartment hotel, motel, resort motel, apartment, apartment motel, roominghouse, tourist or trailer camp, mobile home park, recreational vehicle park, condominium, or timeshare resort.

In lieu of maintaining a copy of the certificate, a dealer may document, before the time of sale, an authorization number provided telephonically or electronically by the department, or by such other means established by rule of the department. The dealer may rely on a resale certificate issued pursuant to s. 212.18(3)(e), valid at the time of receipt from the purchaser, without seeking annual verification of the resale certificate if the dealer makes recurring sales to a purchaser in the normal course of business on a continual basis. For purposes of this paragraph, \u201crecurring sales to a purchaser in the normal course of business\u201d refers to a sale in which the dealer extends credit to the purchaser and records the debt as an account receivable, or in which the dealer sells to a purchaser who has an established cash or C.O.D. account, similar to an open credit account. For purposes of this paragraph, purchases are made from a selling dealer on a continual basis if the selling dealer makes, in the normal course of business, sales to the purchaser at least once in every 12-month period. A dealer may, through the informal protest provided for in s. 213.21 and the rules of the department, provide the department with evidence of the exempt status of a sale. Consumer certificates of exemption executed by those exempt entities that were registered with the department at the time of sale, resale certificates provided by purchasers who were active dealers at the time of sale, and verification by the department of a purchaser\u2019s active dealer status at the time of sale in lieu of a resale certificate shall be accepted by the department when submitted during the protest period, but may not be accepted in any proceeding under chapter 120 or any circuit court action instituted under chapter 72.\n(c)\u2003Unless the purchaser of tangible personal property that is incorporated into tangible personal property manufactured, produced, compounded, processed, or fabricated for one\u2019s own use and subject to the tax imposed under s. 212.06(1)(b) or is purchased for export under s. 212.06(5)(a)1. extends a certificate in compliance with the rules of the department, the dealer shall himself or herself be liable for and pay the tax.\n(2)\u2003A dealer shall, as far as practicable, add the amount of the tax imposed under this chapter to the sale price, and the amount of the tax shall be separately stated as Florida tax on any charge ticket, sales slip, invoice, or other tangible evidence of sale.

Box 6417\nTallahassee, Florida 32314-6417\n(2) Service transactions.\n(a)1. An interior decorator\u2019s so-called fee is taxable as a part of the selling price under Section 212.02(16), F.S., or as a part of the cost price under Section 212.02(4), F.S., and cannot be exempted as a professional or personal service charge when the transaction involves the sale of tangible personal property. This is true when the so-called fee is paid in the form of a trade discount, as is the case when a supplier grants the decorator a trade discount and the decorator in turn bills the client for the full list price. The decorator fee is also taxable when it appears as an amount added to the decorator\u2019s cost when billed to the client for tangible personal property on a cost plus basis.\n2. If the decorator\u2019s fee is solely for designing the interior and exterior decorative scheme or for advising his clients and recommending colors, paints, wallpaper, fabrics, brands, sources of supply, etc., and there is no sale of tangible personal property involved, then such fee would be exempt as a professional or personal service transaction.\n3. In some instances, the decorator may receive a fixed sum, which is not in any way contingent upon the sale of tangible personal property, as a so-called decorator fee. Then, in other completely unrelated transactions, he may sell tangible personal property to the same client. In such cases the decorator\u2019s fee cannot be considered as a part of the selling price of the property sold because there is no connection between the transactions.\n4. If the decorator\u2019s client reimburses the decorator for the payroll cost of personnel on the decorator\u2019s payroll assigned to a specific project, the duties performed by such employees will determine whether or not this item is taxable. For example, if these employees were engaged in painting murals on walls, etc., the charge made for their services is exempt, whereas, if these employees fabricate tangible personal property such as making bedspreads or draperies then the charge for their labor is taxable.\n(b) When an architect or engineer furnishes his client or customer with a scale, working, or other model, the total amount he charges his customer therefor is taxable. This constitutes the sale of tangible personal property and is not exempt as an inconsequential element of a personal service transaction.\n(c) The taking of dictation or the video recording by a public stenographer are exempt as professional services. Charges for attendance and the stenographic or videotape recordings of proceedings at a trial, hearing, conference, or similar function by a court reporter are exempt as professional services. Charges made by court reporters for transcripts or videotapes of proceedings are exempt as professional services when furnished to parties to the proceedings. Charges for transcripts or videotapes to third persons who are not parties to the proceedings for which the reporter was engaged are taxable.\n(3) Guide dogs for the blind.\n(a) A blind person who holds a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption for the Blind (Form DR-152) issued by the Department", "start_char_idx": 756354, "end_char_idx": 760475, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13926821-86a2-4e08-a140-35231b63d0a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "13926821-86a2-4e08-a140-35231b63d0a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb9b63c6-844a-4895-906b-73f06e3be702", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "becfc5ef98e19d61cbb22a1919c05ed6f1cebb54afff17dea6a15065293438ad"}, "3": {"node_id": "0855cb61-ab24-42c8-ba9d-1b1afb658108", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bbe8c5c64e3c26c67f51ebd55e4dc33bdfdcb546d6d0481f8eff89cd8e6136c"}}, "hash": "c0055fb150a2f337959ddd9a151a5a0d9f7c6d7e06b17e8f07fa8aecf252a2d6", "text": "Certificate of Exemption for the Blind (Form DR-152) issued by the Department may purchase or rent a guide dog and purchase food or other items for the guide dog without payment of the tax at the time of purchase.

Be owned or operated exclusively by or on behalf of a county or municipality.\n(b) To obtain certification of the resource recovery equipment or machinery, application must be made to the Department of Environmental Protection. The Department of Environmental Protection will issue a final examination and certification for qualifying resource recovery equipment or machinery after the equipment or machinery is installed and operational. Prior to the purchase and installation of qualifying resource recovery equipment or machinery, a preliminary examination report may be obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection. Persons who obtain a preliminary examination report must also obtain a final examination and certification after the equipment or machinery is installed and operational. Copies of preliminary examination reports and final examination and certifications issued by the Department of Environmental Protection are provided to the Department of Revenue.\n(c)1. Preliminary examination reports. A temporary exemption applies to the resource recovery equipment or machinery specified in the preliminary examination report issued by the Department of Environmental Protection. The temporary exemption is contingent upon final examination and certification of the resource recovery equipment or machinery by the Department of Environmental Protection. \n2. Applicants who have received a preliminary examination report may purchase the resource recovery equipment or machinery identified in the preliminary report tax-exempt. A county or municipality that has received a preliminary examination report may issue a copy of its Florida Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption to make tax-exempt purchases of the identified resource recovery equipment or machinery. Prime contractors and subcontractors who have entered into a contractual agreement with a county or municipality to purchase the identified resource recovery equipment or machinery may purchase the equipment or machinery tax-exempt by issuing a written certification to the selling dealer. The prime contractor or subcontractor must certify that the equipment or machinery qualifies as resource recovery equipment or machinery that will be used exclusively by or on behalf of a county or municipality, as provided in Section 212.08(7)(q), F.S.

Sporting equipment brought into Florida, for a period of not more than 4 months in any calendar year, used by an athletic team or an individual athlete in a sporting event or series of sporting events is exempt from the use tax if such equipment is removed from the state within 7 days after the completion of the sporting event or a series of sporting events.\n1. Example: A major league professional baseball team brings sporting equipment into Florida early in a calendar year for spring training and exhibition games, and keeps the equipment in the state for two and one-half months, and removes it from the state within 7 days after the last of the series of exhibition games. The sporting equipment is exempt from use tax, since it was in the state less than 4 months during the year, and was removed within 7 days after the last of a series of sporting events.\n2. Example: A race car is brought into Florida for racing purposes. It is in the state for less than 4 months in a calendar year. The race car is exempt from use tax if the race car is removed from the state within 7 days after completion of the racing event.\n(b) The exemption authorized, pursuant to Section 212.08(7)(x), F.S., as created by Chapter 87-548, L.O.F., is a use tax exemption, not a sales tax exemption.\nRulemaking Authority 212.08(7)(h)2., (cc)3., 212.18(2), 213.06(1) FS.

The parent-teacher association is not registered as a dealer. The parent-teacher association must pay tax to its suppliers on items sold to students in the book store, but is not required to collect sales tax from the students purchasing items from the book store.\n(d)1. Schools offering grades K through 12, parent-teacher associations, and parent-teacher organizations that do not elect to pay tax to their suppliers on the purchase of items, as provided in paragraph (c), must register in the same manner as other dealers and collect and remit tax on taxable transactions. (See Rule 12A-1.060, F.A.C.) As registered dealers, schools offering grades K through 12, parent-teacher associations, and parent-teacher organizations may issue a copy of their Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) in lieu of paying tax on the purchased items for the purposes of resale.\n2.

For guidelines on the export of these items from Florida, see Rule 12A-1.007, F.A.C.\n(2) Sales of property irrevocably committed to exportation.\n(a) A dealer is required to collect tax on sales of tangible personal property when the property is delivered to the purchaser or the purchaser\u2019s representative in Florida, whether the disclosed or undisclosed intention of the purchaser is to transport the property to a location outside Florida, or whether the property is actually so transported. Every sale of tangible personal property to a person physically present at the time of sale is presumed to have been delivered in Florida.\n(b) When a dealer sells tangible personal property, commits the property to the exportation process at the time of sale, and the exportation process remains continuous and unbroken until the property is exported from Florida, the dealer is not required to collect tax. The intent of the seller and the purchaser to export the property is not sufficient to establish that the property is not subject to tax in Florida. The delivery of the property to a location in Florida for subsequent export from Florida is insufficient to establish documentary evidence that the property sold was irrevocably committed to the exportation process. The following are examples of methods to commit the property to the exportation process at the time of sale:\n1. The dealer is required by the terms of the sale contract to deliver the property outside Florida using the dealer\u2019s own mode of transportation;\n2. The dealer is required by the terms of the sale contract to mail the property by United States mail to a destination located outside Florida; or\n3. The dealer is required by the terms of the sale contract to deliver the property to a carrier, licensed customs broker, or forwarding agent for final and certain movement of the property to a destination located outside Florida.\na. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d means a person regularly engaged in the business of transporting tangible personal property owned by other persons for compensation. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d includes common carriers and contract carriers.\nb. The term \u201clicensed customs broker\u201d means a person licensed by the United States customs service to act as a custom house broker.\nc. The term \u201cforwarding agent\u201d means a person or business whose principal business activity is facilitating for compensation the export of property owned by other persons.\nd. Any person not engaged in the business of receiving tangible personal property owned by other persons and shipping or arranging for shipping for compensation does not become a carrier or forwarding agent by being designated by the purchaser to receive and ship goods to a point outside Florida.\n(c) Any dealer who makes tax-exempt sales of tangible personal property for export outside Florida is required to maintain records to document that the property is committed to the exportation process at the time of sale and that the exportation process is continuous and unbroken until the property is exported from Florida. The dealer is required to maintain records that identify the tangible personal property sold and the delivery destination of the property. The documentation must clearly establish that the property was not commingled with the mass of property within Florida. If the purchaser exercises any act of dominion or control that would constitute \u201cuse\u201d of the property by the purchaser in Florida within the meaning of that term set forth in Section 212.02(20), F.S., the property was not irrevocably committed to the exportation process. Examples of records to document sales for export to points outside Florida are:\n1. Internal delivery orders identifying the property sold and the destination and date of delivery that are supported by receipts of expenses incurred in delivering the property, such as trip tickets or truck logs signed by the person who delivers the property;\n2. United States Postal Service parcel post receipts with supporting documentation identifying the property and the destination;\n3. Common carriers\u2019 receipts, bills of lading, or similar documentation that evidences the delivery destination;\n4. Export declaration;\n5. Receipts from a licensed customs broker; or\n6.

The dealer must maintain documentation that the property was shipped or delivered by the dealer directly to the forwarding agent address.\n2. If tax was not collected by a dealer on tangible personal property shipped to a designated forwarding agent address and the tangible personal property remained in Florida or if delivery to the purchaser or purchaser\u2019s agent occurred in Florida, then the forwarding agent must remit applicable tax on the tangible personal property. This subparagraph does not prohibit the forwarding agent from collecting such tax from the consumer of the tangible personal property.\n(e) A dealer who imports taxable tangible personal property into Florida for exportation from Florida is required to maintain documentation that the imported property was irrevocably committed to the exportation process at the time of importation and that the exportation process was continuous and unbroken while such property was within Florida.\n(f) Regardless of the evidence maintained by the dealer to document delivery of the property to a common carrier, forwarding agent, or a licensed customs broker for shipment to a location outside Florida, or the mailing of the property by the United States mail to a location outside Florida, tax is due when the property is diverted in transit to the purchaser or the purchaser\u2019s agent or representative in Florida and such person takes possession in Florida, or when for any other reason the property is not delivered outside Florida.\n(3) Sales to nonresident dealers.\n(a) The sale of taxable tangible personal property to a nonresident dealer is exempt when the selling dealer obtains a statement from the nonresident dealer declaring that the tangible personal property will be transported outside Florida by the nonresident dealer for resale and for no other purpose. The statement executed by the nonresident dealer must include the declaration and all of the following information:\n1. The nonresident dealer\u2019s name and address;\n2. Evidence of authority to do business in the dealer\u2019s home state or country, such as the nonresident\u2019s business name and address, sales tax registration number, occupational license number, or any other evidence of transacting business in that state or country;\n3.

The tax is due at the moment of the transaction, except when the tax is collected for admission to an event at a convention hall, exhibition hall, auditorium, stadium, theater, arena, civic center, performing arts center, or publicly owned recreational facility. Tax collected on such events is due to the Department on the first day of the month following the actual date of the event for which the admission is sold and becomes delinquent on the 21st day of that month. Therefore, tax collected on season and series tickets for events held in such facilities should be apportioned to each event in the season or series and remitted to the Department accordingly.\n2. An agent who collects admissions on behalf of a principal may forward the collected tax funds to the principal to be remitted by the principal to the Department. Both the principal and agent can be held liable for any failure to timely remit such tax funds to the Department. An agent shall not, however, be liable for its principal\u2019s failure to timely remit tax funds to the Department if the agent has obtained the principal\u2019s active Florida sales tax number and has disclosed in writing to the principal that when such agent remits proceeds from the sale of an admission to the principal the proceeds may include amounts that represent admissions tax and that it is the principal\u2019s obligation to timely remit any taxes due and owing to the Department or other taxing authority.\n3.

A refundable deposit that is paid to reserve the right to purchase season tickets, box seats, or other admissions, that is recorded on the books of the seller as a liability, and that does not entitle the payer to the right to be admitted to the event or events, is not subject to tax. If the refundable deposit is applied to the purchase of the season tickets, box seats, or other admissions, tax is due to the Department as provided in this paragraph.\n(d) Operators of traveling shows, exhibitions, amusements, circuses, carnivals, rodeos, and similar traveling events shall, upon request of an agent of the Department of Revenue, produce a cash receipt or similar documentation evidencing payment to the State of admission taxes due on any or all previous engagements in Florida during their current tour and an itinerary of future engagements in this State during the current year.

The term \u201csupplemental type certificate\u201d is that certificate described in 14 C.F.R., \u00a721.113 (2018).\n2. To document this exemption, the purchaser of the qualifying modification and the business that performed the modification must maintain, in its books and records, copies of the FAA supplemental type certificate and FAA Form 337 containing a description of the major change, signed by a holder of an FAA inspection authorization.\n(g)1. Registered aircraft dealers who purchase aircraft exclusively for resale are exempt from the payment of tax on the purchase price at the time of purchase but shall pay a use tax computed on 1 percent of the value of the aircraft each calendar month that the aircraft is used by the dealer.\n2. The payment of such use tax shall commence in the month during which the aircraft is first used for any purpose for which income is received by the dealer for its use, including charter, rental, flight training, and demonstration where a charge is made.\n3. A dealer may pay the sales tax on the purchase of the aircraft in lieu of the monthly use tax.\n4. The value of the aircraft shall be determined by adding to acquisition cost the cost of reconditioning, if any, and shall generally be the value reflected upon the books of the dealer in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n5.a. Routine maintenance and repairs, including the replacement of parts, which do not materially enhance the value of the aircraft, shall not constitute reconditioning of the aircraft for the purpose of computing the use tax each month. Where such routine repairs and maintenance are performed by the dealer or his employees, tax shall be paid on the parts used in such routine repairs and maintenance. However, where such routine repairs and maintenance are performed by any person other than the dealer or his employees, the total charge for the repairs and maintenance, including the charge for parts or labor, is taxable.\nb.

The guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service as to whether the expense is immediately deductible, or whether the expense is a capital investment which may be depreciated, shall be used in making such determination.\n(h) Notwithstanding the payment by the dealer of tax computed on 1 percent of the value of any aircraft, if the aircraft is leased or rented, the dealer shall collect from the customer and remit to the State the tax which is due on the lease or rental of the aircraft, and such payments shall not diminish or offset any use tax due by the dealer.\n(i) The occasional or isolated sale of an aircraft of a class or type required to be registered, licensed, titled, or documented in this state or by the United States Government is taxable.

The sale or use of a mobile home which is not classified as real property is considered a sale or use of tangible personal property and is taxable. A mobile home is tangible personal property if it is located in a mobile home park or other place where the land on which the mobile home is located is not owned by the mobile home owner.\n2. If a mobile home is classified as tangible personal property, the sale, including the occasional or isolated sale, the use, consumption, or storage for use in this state is taxable on the full sales price.\n3. The sale of a mobile home independent of the realty to which it is affixed at the time of sale constitutes a legal severance of the mobile home from the realty and the sale of the mobile home is taxable as the sale of tangible personal property even though the mobile home may have an \u201cRP\u201d decal affixed thereto at the time of sale.\n4. The sales price of a mobile home which is considered tangible personal property is the total sales price of the mobile home which shall include, if applicable, the sales price of any tangible personal property included within or which becomes a part of, or is attached to the mobile home at the time of the sale of the mobile home. Such tangible personal property may include but is not limited to: interior equipment and furnishings; skylights; carport roof; or storage structures.\n(c) A mobile home park developer (owner) who is also in the business of selling mobile homes and who enters into an agreement with a purchaser for the sale of the mobile home, the placing of the mobile home on the developer\u2019s mobile home lot, and for making certain improvements to the developer\u2019s mobile home lot as requested by the purchaser, shall charge or pay tax as follows:\n1. If the sale of the mobile home, the placing of the mobile home on the developer\u2019s lot, and making improvements to the mobile home lot are for a single lump sum amount, sales tax is due on the total amount. The sales tax is to be separately stated as Florida sales tax in the agreement and on the invoice and is to be collected by the developer from the purchaser. In this instance, the developer may extend his resale certificate for the purchase of the mobile home and for the items used in making improvements to the mobile home lot. Examples of these improvements include mobile home skirting or blocking, screen porches or other attached rooms, central heating and air conditioning units, shrubbery and other plants, lawn grass, and driveways.\n2. If the sale of the mobile home, the placing of the mobile home on the developer\u2019s lot, and the making of improvements to the mobile home lot are separately stated in the agreement and on the invoice, sales tax is due on the selling price of the mobile home and the placing of the mobile home on the developer\u2019s lot. If the agreement provides that the purchaser has an option of having a third party place the mobile home on the developer\u2019s lot, only the sale of the mobile home is subject to tax.

Under this subparagraph, the developer is liable for the tax on its purchases of tangible personal property used in making the improvements to the realty, unless the requirements of paragraph 12A-1.051(3)(d), F.A.C., are met. If the developer contracts with a third party to make improvements to realty, the third party is liable for the tax on the purchase of tangible personal property used in making improvements to the real property.\n(d)1. The sale of a mobile home in conjunction with the sale of land at a time when the mobile home is not real property, either by its not bearing an \u201cRP\u201d decal or at the time of the sale the conditions of paragraph (g) not being satisfied, is a sale of tangible personal property and is taxable. The sales price of the mobile home at such sale, if not separately stated, shall be based upon the larger of:\na. The fair market value; or\nb. The balance of any outstanding liens on the mobile home.\n2. When a person owns real property upon which he permanently affixes a mobile home, such person may request the county property appraiser to assess it as realty. Upon assessment as realty by the property appraiser, the owner may obtain an \u201cRP\u201d decal from the county tax collector. Any repairs, alterations, or improvements of any mobile home that bears an \u201cRP\u201d decal will be treated as the repair, alteration, or improvement to real property. Repairs, alterations, or improvements to mobile homes which do not bear an \u201cRP\u201d decal constitute repairs, alterations, or improvements to tangible personal property.\n(e)1. The sale of land and a mobile home which is classified as real property as a packaged deal is not taxable. The person converting the mobile home into realty is deemed a contractor engaged in improving realty. A mobile home is presumed to be real property when such mobile home bears a valid \u201cRP\u201d decal. A mobile home which does not bear a valid \u201cRP\u201d decal is classified as real property only if:\na. The mobile home is permanently affixed to land owned by the owner of the mobile home. A mobile home is permanently affixed to land for sales tax purposes if the mobile home sits on a foundation with its wheels either removed or off the ground and if the mobile home is connected to utility services; and,\nb. Prior to the sale, and not simultaneously thereto, the owner of the mobile home and of the realty to which it is affixed files with the county property appraiser a declaration requesting the mobile home be assessed as real property.\n2. The provisions of Rule 12A-1.051, F.A.C. (Sales to or by Contractors Who Repair, Alter, Improve, and Construct Real Property), shall not be construed to apply to any instance where a contractor is considered as improving realty by incorporating a mobile home therein nor to any sale of a mobile home to the extent that Rule 12A-1.051, F.A.C., refers to the sale of a mobile home as a sale of tangible personal property.\n(f)1. The rental of a mobile home as tangible personal property is taxable. A mobile home purchased tax exempt for exclusive rental as tangible personal property is subject to use tax if the mobile home ceases to be used for the purpose for which it was purchased. The owner shall accrue and pay to the Department of Revenue use tax computed on the fair market value of the mobile home at the time it is used for any purpose other than exclusively for rental as tangible personal property.\n2. Notwithstanding the fact that a mobile home is subject to a license tax under the Motor Vehicle License Law, it is nevertheless a \u201crooming house\u201d within the meaning of Chapter 212, F.S., when it has a fixed location and is used or held out to the public to be a place where living quarters, sleeping, or housekeeping accommodations are supplied for pay to transient or permanent guests or tenants.

Any prefabricated or modular housing unit or portion thereof which is not manufactured upon a chassis or undercarriage as an integral part thereof is not a mobile home. Any such unit not affixed to realty is subject to the tax as tangible personal property when sold or repaired. When affixed to realty, the sale, repair, alteration, or improvement of any such unit is governed by Rule 12A-1.051, F.A.C.\n2. In the instances of a modular home or prefabricated housing unit or manufactured building, the term \u201caffixed to realty\u201d shall mean a condition whereby the unit or building is either served by utility service other than electricity or is in place on land or on a foundation, or is on, attached to, or incorporated in another structure by any means other than by its own weight.\n3. The sale, use, or rental of a modular home, prefabricated building, or manufactured building before such unit is affixed to realty is taxable as tangible personal property.\n4.a. The terms \u201cmodular home\u201d or \u201cprefabricated housing unit\u201d mean and include structures which are designed to be used as dwellings when connected to the required utilities including the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein, but which are not built on an integral chassis and which are not designed to be transported on their own wheeled assembly.\nb. The term \u201cmanufactured building\u201d means and includes a closed structure, building assembly, or system of assemblies, which may include structural, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, or other service systems manufactured in manufacturing facilities for installation or erection, with or without other specified components, as a finished building or as part of a finished building, which shall include, but not be limited to commercial, institutional, storage, and industrial structures.\n(h) The occasional or isolated sale of a mobile home, when such mobile home is tangible personal property within the meaning of this subsection, is taxable. The internal plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, and attached fixtures, such as built-in ovens, built-in dishwashers, hot water heaters, and built-in furniture, are considered a part of the mobile home and are taxable when sold with the mobile home. However, tax does not apply to the occasional or isolated sale of carports, utility sheds, furniture, freezers, refrigerators, drapes, air conditioner compressor/condenser units located outside the mobile home, or other appurtenances which are sold in conjunction with the mobile home, provided the selling party to the occasional or isolated sale separately describes each appurtenance and separately itemizes the sales price of each appurtenance on his sales invoice and the sales invoice is sworn to before a notary.

The services which are subject to tax in this rule are exempt when performed within this state but used outside this state by the purchaser or when the purchaser\u2019s primary benefit of the services is outside this state. The seller must maintain a log pursuant to paragraph 12A-1.0161(2)(c), F.A.C., documenting any transaction where services are performed in this state but used by a purchaser outside this state.\n1. Example: Company E is located in Georgia and Florida. Company E suspects that its Georgia warehouse manager is stealing merchandise from the company and hires a Florida detective agency to investigate. Irrespective of where the investigative services are performed, since the services do not directly relate to real or tangible personal property located in Florida, nor do they directly relate to the Florida activities of Company E, it is presumed that the primary benefit or use of the detective services is enjoyed in Georgia. Therefore, the investigative services are not taxable.\n2. Example: Company N is a manufacturer located only in Florida. Company N has suffered losses of tangible personal property that it consigned to a location in Illinois. Company N hires a local Illinois detective agency to investigate. All field work is performed in Illinois and a report is directly submitted to Company N in Florida. Although the services were performed outside of Florida, the detective services directly relate to tangible personal property that is still owned by a Florida company and directly related to the Florida company\u2019s activities. Therefore, the primary benefit or use of the services is in Florida, and the services are subject to tax. If the Illinois detective agency is not registered with the State of Florida for sales and use tax purposes, it cannot charge Florida sales tax to Company N, thereby requiring Company N to report and remit use tax on the cost of the investigative services to the State of Florida.\n3. Example: A California art gallery has loaned an important work of art to a Florida art gallery. Security services must be hired to protect this work of art. If the California art gallery is invoiced for the security services, it will be presumed that the primary benefit of the services is to protect the California art gallery\u2019s tangible personal property. Since the services are used by a purchaser who is located outside this state, the security services will not be taxable. If the Florida art gallery is invoiced for the security services, it will be presumed that the primary benefit of the services is to protect the activities of the Florida art gallery, and the charges will be subject to tax.\n(3)(a) If a transaction involves both the sale or use of a service which is taxable and the sale or use of a service which is not taxable, the charges for the taxable portion of the transaction must be separately stated from the charges for the nontaxable portion or the entire transaction will be presumed taxable.\n1.

Since the currency and coin wrapping service is included in the taxable armored car service, the entire charge made by the armored car company to the discount store is subject to tax.\n2. Example: Company A is a defense industry contractor. Company A hires an investigative firm to perform a full background check, including psychological and drug testing, on employment applicants. The investigative firm engages the services of a psychologist and a medical lab to perform the necessary testing procedures. The professional services of the psychologist and the medical lab do not fall within the taxable services enumerated in subsection (1). However, the charge that the investigative firm makes to Company A for the psychological and drug testing must be separately stated or the entire transaction will be subject to tax.\n3. Example: A security company has a contract to provide monthly security services for Company C\u2019s physical facility. Company C has requested the security company to provide personal security classes to Company C\u2019s employees. The personal security classes are separate from and not included in the security services for the physical facility. The personal security instruction classes will not be subject to tax, provided the security company separately states or itemizes the instruction charges on the monthly service billing to Company C.\n(b) Investigative services provided to private attorneys are not exempt, unless such services are those which are enumerated in paragraph (2)(c) above.\n(c) Investigative or security services provided directly to a governmental entity that is exempt from sales and use taxes under Section 212.08(6), F.S., are exempt if payment is made directly by the governmental entity. Such services are not exempt when provided to a contractor for a governmental entity.\n(d) There can be no deduction from the taxable sales price of a service for expenses incurred in activities necessary for the performance of the service or for any taxes paid on those expenses.\n1. Example: A security company provides security to a client for $125,000 a year. That contract incurs $85,500 in direct wages for several security guards. The security service pays $6,541 in Social Security (FICA) taxes on the wages paid to the security guards. Neither the $85,500 in wages nor the $6,541 in FICA tax can be deducted from the $125,000 charge for this taxable service when computing the sales tax.\n2. Example: A private investigator, in performing a taxable service for a client, stays in a hotel room, for which he pays $100 plus $6 tax. He bills the client $500 for his service, plus reimbursement of the $106 expenses incurred in performing the service. The tax on the investigator\u2019s service will be six percent of the $606 total charged, or $36.36.\n(e)1. A deduction is not allowed from the taxable sales price of a service for the service provider\u2019s overhead or administrative costs incurred to support the services provided.\n2. Example: A security company provides security to a client under a contract that provides for thirty percent of the total charge to be for services incurred in support of providing security, but not in the actual provision of security, such as administrative, personnel, training, and other support activities. In computing the tax on the service there can be no deduction of such expenses from the total charge for the service.\n(f) In the event of an audit by the Department of Revenue, pursuant to Section 212.13, F.S., a service provider will not be required to divulge any information that it is prohibited from divulging under Section 493.6119, F.S.\n1. Example: A detective agency performs a taxable service for a client and it discovers certain information. If the agency is audited, the agency is required to provide access to its records indicating that it provided the service and the amount charged for the service, but the agency cannot be required to provide access to records divulging any information it is prohibited from divulging under Section 493.6119, F.S.\n2.

A number of pages of the agency\u2019s records contain both information pertinent to the taxability of services and information that cannot be divulged without violating Section 493.6119, F.S. The agency is required to provide the auditor with photocopies of those pages on which the confidential information has been blocked out.\n(4) A shopping mall providing security services for its tenants is required to charge and collect tax on the security service.\n(5)(a)1. Any law enforcement officer, as defined in Section 943.10, F.S., who is performing approved duties as determined by his law enforcement agency, in his capacity as a law enforcement officer subject to the direct and immediate command of his law enforcement officer subject to the direct and immediate command of his law enforcement agency, and in the uniform of his law enforcement agency, is performing law enforcement and public safety services and is not performing detective, burglar protection, or other protective services, if the law enforcement officer is performing his approved duties in a geographical area in which the law enforcement officer has arrest jurisdiction. Such law enforcement and public safety services are not subject to tax irrespective of whether the duty is characterized as \u201cextra duty,\u201d \u201coff-duty,\u201d or \u201csecondary employment,\u201d and irrespective of whether the officer is paid directly or through his agency by an outside source. The term \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d includes full-time or part-time law enforcement officers, and any auxiliary law enforcement officer, when such auxiliary law enforcement officer is working under the direct supervision of a full-time or part-time law enforcement officer.\n2. Example: A deputy sheriff is a full-time employee of county \u201cA\u201d. During his off-duty hours, he is employed on a contract basis as a security guard by a department store in county \u201cB\u201d. The deputy sheriff is not an employee of the department store. Since the sheriff\u2019s department in county \u201cA\u201d does not have law enforcement jurisdiction in county \u201cB\u201d, the charge the deputy makes to the department store for providing security guard service is subject to tax.\n(b)1. The consideration paid solely for directing the control of vehicular traffic not associated with protection services provided to particular persons or properties is not taxable. However, the consideration paid for protection services provided to particular persons or properties, which may include some traffic control, is fully taxable.\n2. Example: A major celebrity will be appearing at the grand opening of a department store. The department store engages a security company to provide security officers for the protection of the celebrity. Since the celebrity will be appearing outside the main entrance to the department store, some of the security officers will be used to direct the extra anticipated vehicle traffic in the parking lot in front of the department store\u2019s main entrance. The total charge made by the security company to the department store for the protection services is taxable.\n3.

Bakery products, excluding bakery products sold for consumption off the premises, sold by bakeries, pastry shops, or like establishments that have eating facilities are subject to tax.\n2. For purposes of this subsection, \u201ceating facility\u201d is a place that facilitates the consumption of the bakery products on the seller\u2019s premises on items such as benches, chairs, stools, tables, and counters. For example, a pastry shop that has bar stools and a counter where the bakery products and drinks are served to patrons will be considered a pastry shop with eating facilities. A bakery located within the food court of a mall where tables and chairs are located in the common areas of the food court for patrons to consume food products will be considered a bakery with eating facilities.\n(c)1. Bakery products, excluding items sold as hot prepared food products, sold for consumption off the premises are exempt.\n2.

Such bakery products are sold in quantities of five (5) or fewer items; or\nb. The bakery products sold, regardless of the quantity, are not packaged in a manner consistent with an intention by the customer to consume the products off the seller\u2019s premises.\n3. Bakery products that are sold, regardless of the quantity, in packaging that is glued, stapled, wrapped, or sealed are examples of packaging consistent with an intention by the customer to consume products off the seller\u2019s premises.\n4. Bakeries, pastry shops, or like establishments that have eating facilities and make tax-exempt sales of bakery products that are for consumption off the premises are required to separately account for the tax-exempt sales of bakery products for consumption off the premises.\na. Examples of methods to separately account for tax-exempt sales of bakery products for consumption off the premises are: using sales invoices which contain documentation that the sale of the bakery product is for consumption off the premises; using a separate key on a cash register to record tax-exempt sales of bakery products; or using a separate cash register to record tax-exempt sales of bakery products.\nb.

Example. A bakery operates an establishment with eating facilities. The bakery sells donuts, toasted bagels, and other pastries, as well as coffee and other drinks. The bakery sells bakery products to patrons who take the products home for consumption in sealed containers. Products sold for consumption on the premises are served to the customers on trays. The bakery uses separate keys on its cash registers to account for the sales of tax-exempt bakery products to patrons who purchase the products for consumption off the premises in sealed containers separately from the accounting for taxable sales of toasted bagels, coffee, other drinks, and bakery products for consumption on the premises. The bakery products sold for consumption off the premises are exempt, because the bakery\u2019s packaging and accounting methods overcome the rebuttable presumption that the products are sold for consumption on the premises.\n(d) Bakery products, excluding items sold as a hot prepared food products, that are sold by bakeries, pastry shops, or like establishments that do not have eating facilities are exempt.\n(4) Taxable food products. The exemption for food products for human consumption does not apply to any of the items specified in this subsection.\n(a) Candy, chewing gum, bubble gum, breath mints, and any similar product regarded as candy or confection, based on its normal use as indicated on the label or advertising, is subject to tax. The term \u201ccandy and similar products\u201d does not include snack foods not regarded as candy or confection, as indicated on the label or advertising of the product.\n(b) Food prepared, whether on or off the seller\u2019s premises, and sold for immediate consumption is subject to tax. This does not apply to food prepared off the seller\u2019s premises and sold in the original sealed container, or to the slicing of products into smaller portions.\n1. Food prepared for immediate consumption is food prepared to a point generally accepted as ready to be eaten without further preparation and that is sold in a manner that suggests readiness for immediate consumption. In determining whether an item of food is sold for immediate consumption, the customary consumption practices prevailing at the selling facility shall be considered.\n2. Examples:\na. Potato salad is prepared and delivered to a dealer in bulk. The dealer repackages the potato salad into smaller containers. Because the potato salad is not sold in the original sealed container, the sale of the repackaged smaller containers of potato salad is subject to tax.\nb. A grocery store buys cold cuts in five-pound packages. The grocery store slices cold cuts for the customer according to the thickness and the amount the customer desires. The food is then packaged for sale to the customer. Because the cold cuts are sliced into smaller portions, the sale of the cold cuts is exempt from tax.\nc. A supermarket offers freshly popped popcorn for shoppers for sale. The sale of the popcorn is subject to tax.\nd. A supermarket prepares seafood products, such as smoked fish or steamed shrimp, for sale. The sale of the smoked fish or steamed shrimp is subject to tax.\ne. A supermarket prepares fruit and vegetable products into various fresh salads for sale. When packaged without eating utensils and sold as a grocery item, the sale of the prepared fresh fruit or vegetable salad is exempt. When the prepared fresh salads are packaged with eating utensils, such as with a fork and a napkin, the salad is a food product prepared and sold for immediate consumption and is subject to tax.\n(c)1. Hot prepared food products, whether sold separately or in combination with other food items, when the food is heated by the seller rather than by the customer, is subject to tax.\n2. Hot prepared food products are those products, items, or components that have been prepared for sale in a heated condition and sold at any temperature that is higher than the air temperature of the room or place where the products are sold.

In addition, where fees paid to that person are not subject to withholding taxes or social security taxes, that person is not considered an employee of the company. Therefore, that person\u2019s taxable services are subject to sales tax.\n2. Example: B and Company X are cleaning service contractors.

As such, the service provider is liable for the sales and use tax on any purchases of tangible personal property used in providing the services.\n(6) If a transaction involves both the sale of a taxable service as provided in subsection (1) above, and the sale of a service that is not taxable, or if it involves both the sale of a taxable service and the sale or use of property that is not subject to sales or use tax, the charges shall be separately identified and stated with respect to the taxable and nontaxable portions of the transaction. The tax shall apply to the transaction to the extent that the consideration paid in connection with the transaction is payment for the sale of taxable services. Failure to separately state the charges shall create a presumption that the entire transaction is a taxable service. The burden shall be on the seller of the service or the purchaser of the service, whichever is applicable, to overcome this presumption by providing documentary evidence (i.e., time sheets, schedules, receipts, or other documents which support activities) as to the amount of the transaction that is exempt from tax.

Where a dealer quotes the purchaser a list price with a deduction as a trade discount, the tax is to be computed on the list price less the trade discount. A trade discount is an expedient for adjusting list prices and is to be deducted in arriving at the true selling price of the property.\n(2) Discounts allowed and taken at the time of sale are deducted from the selling price, and the tax is due on the net amount paid at the time of sale. Discounts granted for payment within a specified period or upon a specified later date are not deemed discounts at the time of sale, and may not be deducted from the selling price for purposes of computing the tax.\n(3) A coupon or refund issued directly by the manufacturer is not to be construed as a reduction in selling price by the dealer. In this case, as illustrated by the following examples, the full selling price of the product is taxable.\n(a) Example A: An automobile is sold to a customer for $5,000 with a $500 \u201cfactory rebate.\u201d The customer pays the dealer $5,000 for the automobile.

The distribution or sale by an entity in complete liquidation of non-inventory tangible personal property is made pursuant to the dissolution of that entity or a division thereof.\n4. There is a transfer of tangible personal property to an acquiring corporation, where the acquiring corporation, in addition to exchanging its stock, either assumes a liability or pays boot in exchange for tangible personal property, provided that the fair market value of the stock exchanged for the tangible personal property represents at least 80% of the fair market value of the total consideration given for the tangible personal property.\n(c) An exempt isolated sale or transaction may also occur when the transfer of non-inventory tangible personal property by an entity is in exchange for the surrender of a proportionate interest in the entity held by the transferee. Example: A, B, and C each hold one-third interest in Partnership.

If the sale of the business is not completed within the 30 day period, the sale may nevertheless qualify as an occasional sale provided the sale complies with the requirements in subsection (3), below, and provided none of the elements set forth in subsection (5), below, are present.\n(3)(a) An exempt occasional sale or series of sales occurs when there is a sale by the owner of tangible personal property, which meets the requirements set forth below, regarding the frequency and duration of the sales, the type of tangible personal property sold, the location of the sales, and the status of the parties as it relates to the property being sold.\n(b) An exempt occasional sale or series of sales by the owner of tangible personal property must occur under the following circumstances:\n1. The seller must have paid any applicable sales or use tax on such property unless at the time of sale the statute of limitations for assessment of sales and use tax on the property had expired, as provided in Section 95.091(3), F.S.\n2. Such sales or series of sales occur no more frequently than two times during any 12-month period.\na. The third sale or series of sales in this State of such property during any 12-month period makes that person engaged in the business, and that person is required to register as a dealer and required to collect and remit tax on such third sale or series of sales and on all subsequent sales until such sales or series of sales occur no more than two times within any 12-month period. A dealer that is no longer required to be registered must cancel its sales tax registration. Once the registration is canceled, the seller cannot make more than two sales or series of sales within any 12-month period without being required to register again as a dealer.\nb. The term \u201cseries of sales,\u201d for purposes of this rule, means any multiple sales of tangible personal property, for a limited duration not to exceed 30 consecutive days, which as to any single sale within the series of sales would not be taxable under the requirements set forth in this rule for", "start_char_idx": 1133531, "end_char_idx": 1137765, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0943ff10-ec98-46c4-80dd-aba1ad78e7f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0943ff10-ec98-46c4-80dd-aba1ad78e7f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "e13b324f-133a-403f-8441-d44e3542660d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "65d93acdeb49d99d1260b4bd6f5d15635106109287933067a348c64b2ea5a2e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "663e1532-c883-4794-89ba-64fe17ac571d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e7b68989eaac55d8377b8c0203f85965a968fb0aef0c6452e8af35b86f64b91"}}, "hash": "293a91f66c4a49da7b8af02b3710986d316550a7703ce8600c9b077dc3c9e397", "text": "the series of sales would not be taxable under the requirements set forth in this rule for each such single sale. Each series of sales shall be considered a single sale. Example: A carpet retailer conducts a two day sale to dispose of its used office equipment. The multiple sales made by the dealer during those two days constitute a single sale, for purposes of the occasional sales tax exemption, since the sales took place within the limited duration which did not exceed 30 consecutive days; therefore, the sale is exempt from tax.\nc. For purposes of determining whether a sale qualifies as an occasional sale, an entity with more than one place of operation in the State of Florida shall be considered a single entity. Example: X Corp wishes to sell its used office furniture and equipment; it operates from A, B, C, and D locations. The A location holds a sale on January 1st; the B location holds a sale on January 15th; the C location holds a sale in May; and the D location holds a sale in August. The sales made by the A and B locations constitute a single sale, since the same entity, X Corp, sold the tangible personal property within 30 consecutive days; therefore, the sales made at the A and B locations may qualify as occasional sales. The sales made by the C location constitute a second sale by X Corp, and may qualify as the second occasional sale, because such sale did not occur within 30 days from the January 1st sale. However, the sales made by the D location constitute a third sale by X Corp, and shall not qualify as an occasional sale.\n3. Sales by a dealer of tangible personal property that was used in the business, which is not inventory and which was not originally purchased for resale, may qualify as an occasional sale, regardless of the items\u2019 similarity to any items sold in the regular course of the dealer\u2019s trade or business, provided the items are not specifically excluded, as set forth in subsection (5) of this rule, from the occasional sales exemption, and provided all other requirements set forth herein are met.\na. Example: Sales by a farmer of his farm machinery or equipment, or by a grocery store of its cash registers and other equipment, or by an office supply company of its (fixed assets) office furniture are exempt if:\n(I) Such sales or series of sales do not occur more than two times within any 12-month period;\n(II) Such tangible personal property was not inventory; and,\n(III) Such tangible personal property was not originally purchased or acquired for resale.\nb. Example: X Corp is in the business of manufacturing baseball equipment, including baseballs, gloves, and bats. X Corp has decided to discontinue the production of gloves and will sell all the manufacturing equipment used for the production of gloves. The sale of the glove production equipment may qualify as an isolated sale of a division, as provided in subsection (2) above, or it may otherwise qualify as an occasional sale. However, the sale of gloves in inventory that were originally manufactured for resale does not qualify as an occasional sale.\n(4) An occasional sale of taxable services occurs when the seller does not hold himself out as engaged in the business of selling such services and the sale of the services occurs no more than two times during any 12-month period.\n(5) The sale of tangible personal property, or the sale of services, under any one of the following circumstances, is taxable and is not an occasional sale if:\n(a) Such sale or series of sales occurs more than two times within any 12-month period (tax shall apply only to the third and subsequent sale(s)).\n(b) Such property was originally purchased or acquired for resale.\n(c) Such sale or series of sales are made on the same commercial premises or from a location, which is not its fixed and permanent business location, and which is in competition with other persons required to collect tax, regardless of whether such sales may otherwise qualify as occasional sales, and regardless of the similarity of the tangible personal property to that of the other dealers\u2019 tangible personal", "start_char_idx": 1137753, "end_char_idx": 1141852, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "663e1532-c883-4794-89ba-64fe17ac571d": {"__data__": {"id_": "663e1532-c883-4794-89ba-64fe17ac571d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "0943ff10-ec98-46c4-80dd-aba1ad78e7f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "293a91f66c4a49da7b8af02b3710986d316550a7703ce8600c9b077dc3c9e397"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fcef1c0-c200-469b-b799-0fc251371946", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "865bfd01faf79977438fe1c09540d352b65301ce0f1214c8864cfedd6c0cd9b6"}}, "hash": "7e7b68989eaac55d8377b8c0203f85965a968fb0aef0c6452e8af35b86f64b91", "text": "similarity of the tangible personal property to that of the other dealers\u2019 tangible personal property.\n(d)1.

Example: A city holds a parade which attracts sellers of tangible personal property, including, but not limited to, arts and crafts vendors. The city designates a specific area where the arts and crafts and other vendors\u2019 items are to be sold. The sale of the arts and crafts is taxable, even if the arts and crafts are sold by non-profit organizations, and even if the sale would otherwise qualify as an occasional sale, because the sellers of the arts and crafts are selling at a location which is in competition with other vendors that are required to be registered. Therefore, the sale of the arts and crafts is not an occasional sale, and the sellers of arts and crafts must register as dealers.\n(e) Such sale is made by or through an auctioneer, agent, broker, factor, or any other person required to be registered as a dealer to collect and remit tax on such sales, as provided in Rule 12A-1.066, F.A.C.\n(f) Such sale involves an aircraft, boat, mobile home, or motor vehicle of a class or type required to be registered, licensed, titled, or documented in this state or by the United States Government.

If a rental transaction of tangible personal property covers a period in excess of 30 days, each 30 day increment, or portion thereof, will be considered a single rental transaction and shall constitute one sale.\n(c) If a rental transaction exceeds the frequency requirement set forth in subsection (3), above, as modified by paragraphs (6)(a) and (b) above, no portion of that rental transaction shall be exempt as an occasional rental.\n1. Example: Contractor X owns and operates bulldozers and other equipment (other than vehicles described in subparagraph (2)(a)1.) used in land clearing. Contractor X paid the applicable tax on the purchase of the equipment, and generally does not lease any of its equipment. However, in a 12-month period, Contractor X entered into three separate 30-day term operating leases, for the lease of a bulldozer to Contractor Y (without an operator). The first two 30-day leases qualify as occasional operating leases and are exempt from tax.

Example: An individual, who was not previously in the business of renting computers, rents a computer for a term of six months in exchange for $300. The rental of the computer is not an occasional rental, and the entire amount paid for the full term of the rental is taxable, because each 30 day period is treated as a sale so that a six month rental constitutes six sales.\n(7) The sales of second hand goods in a second hand store are not occasional sales, because second hand stores are in the business of selling such goods, and such items were purchased or acquired for resale.\n(8)(a) A sale or series of sales of tangible personal property consisting of household goods or personal effects is an occasional sale if such sales comply with the requirements in subsection (3) above, and provided none of the elements set forth in subsection (5) above, are present.\n(b) Such sale or series of sales must be by an individual(s) at his or her residence or at some other site, which is not on the same premises in competition with other persons required to collect tax.\n1. Example: A garage sale of household goods and personal effects is held at a residence for several hours during a weekend. The sale or series of sales made by the owner of the tangible personal property qualifies as a single sale for purposes of the occasional sales tax exemption, provided this is the first or second such sale or series of sales within the immediately preceding 12-month period, and that such items were not purchased for resale.\n2. Example: An individual holds three garage sales. One is on the second weekend of April, another is on the second weekend of June, and the final sale is on the second weekend of August. The April garage sale constitutes one sale or series of sales and may qualify as an occasional sale or series of sales. The June garage sale constitutes a second sale or series of sales, since it did not take place within 30 consecutive days from the April sale, and may also qualify as an occasional sale or series of sales. However, the August sale constitutes a third garage sale, since it did not take place within 30 consecutive days from the June sale; therefore, it may not qualify as an occasional sale of series or sales. Accordingly, for the August and future garage sales, the individual is required to register with the Department as a dealer, and is required to collect and remit sales tax on all taxable items of tangible personal property sold, until the individual makes no more than two garage sales or series of sales within any 12-month period.\n(9) The sale by the Federal Government, including sales made by U.S. Marshals, of surplus government property or confiscated property is not subject to tax. However, no title certificate may be issued on any boat, mobile home, or motor vehicle or, if no title is required by law, no license or registration may be issued for any aircraft, boat, mobile home, motor vehicle, or other vehicle unless the purchaser files with the application for title certificate, license, or registration certificate a receipt issued by the Department of Revenue, its designated agent, or a county tax collector, evidencing payment of the tax where the same is payable.\n(10)(a) The sale of tangible personal property, except unclaimed property pursuant to Section 717.122, F.S., by an agency of the state, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision of this state is taxable, provided the sale does not otherwise qualify as an occasional sale.\n(b) In the case of aircraft, boats, mobile homes, motor vehicles, or other vehicles, such governmental unit shall collect and remit the tax and shall furnish the purchaser with a receipt thereof evidencing payment of the tax where the same is payable.

For purposes of this rule, \u201cbullion\u201d means gold, silver, or platinum in the form of bars, ingots, or plates, normally sold by weight. Finished goods, such as coins and jewelry, are not bullion. Sales of commodity contracts of bullion are not subject to tax unless delivery of the commodity is taken in Florida.\n(3)(a)1. The sale of coins or currency, in a single transaction, is exempt when the sales price charged for coins or currency that are not legal tender of the United States or legal tender of another country sold at its face value exceeds $500.\n2. Example: In one transaction, an investor purchases one United States $20 coin, called a gold double eagle, for $295, one Krugerrand for $295, and one one-ounce gold ingot for $295. Because the gold double eagle is United States legal tender, its sale is not subject to tax. The sale of the gold ingot is not a taxable sale of coins or currency, but is a taxable sale of bullion. The sale of the Krugerrand is a taxable sale of coins or currency. Because the portion of the sales price charged for taxable coins or currency is $295, the transaction does not qualify for exemption and the sale of the Krugerrand and the ingot is taxable.\n(b)1. The sale of gold, silver, or platinum bullion, or any combination thereof, in a single transaction, is exempt when the total sales price of such bullion exceeds $500.\n2. Example: An investor purchases two one-ounce gold ingots and one one-ounce platinum ingot in one transaction for $1,020. The sale is exempt, because the sales price of the bullion exceeds $500.\n(c) For purposes of this rule, a \u201csingle transaction\u201d has the same meaning as the term \u201csingle sale,\u201d described in Rule 12A-1.003, F.A.C.\n(4) Jewelry or other objects made or fabricated by incorporating or using coins, currency, or bullion are subject to tax. Tax is due on the total sales price of the jewelry or other objects, without deduction or credit for the price or value of the coins, currency, or bullion.\n(5) When coins or currency that are in circulation in, and the legal tender of, a nation are exchanged for coins or currency in circulation in, and legal tender of, another nation, no tax is due when the coins or currency are exchanged solely for use as legal tender and the rate of the exchange is based on the value of each nation\u2019s coins or currency as a medium of exchange.\n(6) The dealer must maintain proper documentation to exempt, in whole or in part, the sale of coins, currency, or bullion until tax imposed by Chapter 212, F.S., may no longer be determined and assessed under Section 95.091(3), F.S. Failure to maintain and preserve proper documentation will subject the entire transaction to tax. Proper documentation, in the case of a transaction involving coins or currency, will describe the country, issue, grade, denomination, face value, and sales price of each item of coin or currency and additional information to clearly identify each coin or currency.

The exempt nature of the transaction must be established by the selling dealer. Unless the selling dealer shall have taken from the purchaser the required documentation as provided in subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this rule, the sale shall be deemed to be taxable. Subsection (3) of this rule governs sales made to exempt entities (other than governmental units) that hold a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption. Subsection (4) of this rule governs sales made directly to governmental units. Subsection (5) of this rule governs sales exempt based on the use of the property or services.\n(2) How to obtain a consumer\u2019s certificate of exemption.\n(a)1. Any organization determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be currently exempt from federal income tax pursuant to s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, any state, county, municipality, or other political subdivision of a state, qualifying for the exemption provided in Section 212.08(6), F.S., any state chartered credit union qualifying for exemption under Section 213.12(2), F.S., and any other organization qualifying for exemption under Section 212.08(7), F.S., desiring to qualify for these exemptions must obtain a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption. Any limited liability company determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be currently exempt from federal income tax pursuant to s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, must obtain a separate Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption, even though its parent corporation may currently hold a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption. The United States Government or any of its federal agencies is not required to obtain a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption.\n2. To obtain a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption, the organization must file an Application for a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption (Form DR-5, incorporated by reference in Rule 12A-1.097, F.A.C.) and documentation sufficient to substantiate the applicant\u2019s claim for exemption with the Department. The Department will issue a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption (Form DR-14) to each applicant qualifying for exemption under Section 212.08(6) or (7) or 213.12(2), F.S.\n(b) A Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption will be valid from its \u201cIssue Date\u201d through its \u201cExpiration Date,\u201d as indicated on the certificate (Form DR-14). Any dealer selling taxable property, services, or admissions to an exempt entity prior to the date of issue, or after the date of expiration, indicated on the exempt entity\u2019s Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption, is required to collect tax. An entity whose Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption has been revoked by the Department is prohibited from extending a copy of its certificate to purchase taxable property, services, or admissions exempt from tax. However, a selling dealer who accepts in good faith a copy of a Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption that appears valid and current on its face will not be liable for any applicable tax due on sales to the entity or subject to other punitive actions.\n(3) Sales made to exempt entities other than governmental units.\n(a) An entity that holds a valid Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption (Form DR-14) issued by the Florida Department of Revenue may extend a copy of its certificate to the selling dealer to purchase or rent taxable property, admissions, or services used for its authorized tax-exempt purpose in lieu of paying sales tax.

The fact that an entity holds an exemption from federal income tax pursuant to s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is not sufficient to make tax exempt purchases or rentals in Florida.\n(e) An entity holding a valid Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption may not extend a copy of its certificate to a contractor to be applied to contracts for the construction or improvement of real property. See Rule 12A-1.094, F.A.C., for guidance on direct purchases by governmental entities of construction materials in real property projects.\n(f) The validity of a Florida Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption may be verified by using the Department\u2019s online Certificate Verification System at www.floridarevenue.com/taxes/certificates, by using the Department\u2019s FL Tax mobile application, or by calling the Department\u2019s automated nationwide toll-free verification system at 1(877)357-3725.

In response to the request, the Department will issue to the selling dealer, using the same electronic medium, a list containing a unique vendor authorization number for each exempt entity who is a holder of a valid Florida Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption.\nb. The Department\u2019s online Certificate Verification System allows the user to verify up to five Florida Consumer\u2019s Certificate numbers and to obtain a transaction authorization number for single sales made to each exempt entity at once. The system also allows the user to upload a batch file of up to 50,000 accounts for verification of a Florida Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption and, 24 hours later, retrieve the file containing the vendor authorization numbers for all sales made to an exempt entity during the calendar year.\n4. The selling dealer may make tax-exempt sales to the exempt entity during the period in which the vendor authorization number for that entity is valid. Vendor authorization numbers are valid for the remainder of the calendar year during which they are issued. However, vendor authorization numbers issued by the Department in November or December are valid for the remainder of that calendar year and the next calendar year.\n(4) Sales made directly to governmental units.\n(a) Any state, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision of a state that holds a valid Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption (Form DR-14) issued by the Florida Department of Revenue may issue a copy of its certificate to the selling dealer to purchase or rent taxable items or services tax-exempt in lieu of paying sales tax.

In lieu of obtaining a copy of the purchaser\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate for each tax-exempt sale made for the purposes of resale, the selling dealer may obtain a Transaction Resale Authorization Number or a Vendor Resale Authorization Number from the Department.\n1.

Absent such written designation, the owner of the machine shall be deemed to be the operator.\n(2) All sales made through vending machines of food, beverages, or other items are taxed in the manner provided in Section 212.0515(2), F.S., except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b). See subsection (2) of Rule 12A-15.011, F.A.C., for the effective tax rates for sales made through vending machines in counties imposing a discretionary sales surtax.\n(a) Receipts from vending machines owned and operated by churches or synagogues are exempt.\n(b) Food and drinks sold for human consumption for 25 cents or less through a coin-operated vending machine sponsored by a nonprofit corporation under s. 501(c)(3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are exempt.\n(c) Food and beverages sold or dispensed through vending machines or other dispensing devices located in the student lunchroom, student dining room, or other area designated for student dining in state-supported or parochial, church, and nonprofit private schools operated for and attended by pupils of grades K through 12 are exempt. See Rule 12A-1.0011, F.A.C.\n(3) Registration. Owners or operators of vending machines must obtain a separate Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Registration (Form DR-11) for each county in which the machines are located. One Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Registration is sufficient for all the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s machines within a single county. See Rule 12A-1.060, F.A.C. Registration violations may be reported by calling 1(800)352-9273.\n(4) Purchases or leases of vending machines.\n(a) The purchase or repair of a vending machine is subject to tax.\n(b) The purchase of machines, machine parts and repairs, and replacements thereof that are a component part of the machine, by the machine owner or lessor for exclusive rental is exempt. The machine owner or lessor must register with the Department and must issue a copy of the dealer\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate to the selling dealer to purchase these items tax exempt for the purposes of leasing or renting the machine.\n(c) The lease or license to use a vending machine to an operator is taxable. The tax is to be collected by the machine owner or lessor from the operator. When there is an oral or written agreement for the lease or license to use a vending machine with a location owner (where the machines are located), the location owner (lessee) is required to be the operator of the machine. Sales tax shall be collected by the machine owner or lessor from the operator based on the amount the machine owner receives for the lease or license to use the machine.\n(d) The purchase of machines, machine parts and repairs, and replacements thereof that become a component part of the machine, by the machine owner is taxable.\n(5) If the machine operator (owner or lessee) has obtained a direct pay permit from the Department, the permit may be presented to the location owner. The direct pay permit authorizes the machine operator to self-accrue and remit the tax due on the lease or license to use the real property and relieves the location owner of this obligation.\n(6) The following examples are intended to provide further clarification of the provisions of this section:\n(a) Example: A vending machine owner enters into a license agreement with City Airport, which grants the machine owner the right to place vending machines in Concourse A.

City Airport has the right to designate the areas within the concourse where the machines will be located; the machine owner is the operator and the machine owner and owner\u2019s employees are to stock the machines and provide repairs as needed. The machine owner (operator) is required to remit the tax on the total proceeds from the machines. In addition, as consideration under the agreement, City Airport will receive 15 percent of all proceeds from the machines. By the terms of the agreement, this arrangement is a license to use real property, and City Airport, as the licensor, must collect tax from the machine owner.\n(b) Example: When a bottler removes a drink vending machine from inventory to be placed at a location on a \u201cfill service basis\u201d and collects a \u201cservice charge\u201d from the location operator for keeping the machine stocked with drinks it sells the location operator, the bottler shall declare and remit to the Department of Revenue a use tax on the value of such vending machine of 6 percent when title to the vending machine remains with the bottler and the service charge collected covers stocking the machine, making necessary repairs, repainting, and maintenance. The service charge is not taxable. All parts used in repairing the machines shall be taxed at 6 percent as use tax. The tax on all merchandise sold through the machine at 10 cents per bottle or more shall be reported to the Department by the location operator.\n(c) Example: A bottler who removes from inventory a drink vending machine to be placed at a location on a \u201cfull service basis\u201d and pays the location owner consideration for the right to place the machine at the location shall declare and remit to the Department of Revenue a use tax on the value of the vending machine when it is removed from inventory. All parts used in repairing the machine shall be taxed at 6 percent as use tax. The bottler is considered to be the operator of the machine. The tax due on all merchandise sold through the machine at 10 cents per bottle or more shall be reported by the bottler. The location owner shall collect tax from the bottler on the amount the location owner receives as a lease or license to use the real property.\n(d) Example: When a bottler removes from inventory a drink vending machine to be placed at a location under an agreement where the location owner is the operator, the bottler, as a registered dealer, may extend a copy of the dealer\u2019 Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to purchase vending machines or component parts for exclusive rental. The rental of the vending machine may either be on a per case basis or a flat monthly rate. In such instances, the tax must be collected by the bottler and remitted at the rate of 6 percent of the amount received as rental. Also, tax is due on all merchandise sold through the machine by the location owner (operator).\n(7) If any vending machine used on a full service basis or for exclusive rental is later sold as a \u201cused\u201d machine, the sale to the purchasing customer is subject to tax.\nRulemaking Authority 212.0515, 212.18(2), 213.06(1) FS.

Example: X is in the business of selling liquefied petroleum (L.P.) gas, gas tanks, and other related equipment. Y agrees to purchase a 500 gallon above ground tank from X to be placed at Y\u2019s place of business and to make future purchases of L.P. gas from X. X requires a delivery fee of $25 for each L.P. gas tank that it sells and will not allow the customer to pick up the tank nor make arrangements with any other transportation company to deliver the tank to the designated place. Since the $25 delivery fee is required by the seller and is not an option to the buyer, the invoice correctly includes the $25 delivery charge in the amount subject to tax as follows:\n500 Gallon L.P. Gas Tank\t$500.00\nDelivery Fee\t$25.00\nTotal Taxable Amount\t$525.00\n2. Example: X places an order to purchase a jacket for $100 with a mail order company. The mail order company\u2019s policy is that all items are shipped F.O.B. destination through the U.S. mail or by common carrier as the method of shipping its merchandise to its customers. The mail order company makes a separate charge to all of its customers for transportation based on the weight of the item sold and the distance required to deliver the item to the desired place. Since the method of shipping is mandated by the mail order company, the transportation charge becomes a part of the sales price. The invoice correctly includes the transportation charge in the amount subject to tax as follows:\nJacket #5054\t$100.00\nShipping and Handling Charges\t$8.75\nTotal Taxable Amount\t$108.75\n(4)(a) The charge for transportation services is not subject to tax when both of the following conditions have been met:\n1. The charge is separately stated on an invoice or bill of sale; and,\n2. The charge can be avoided by a decision or action solely on the part of the purchaser. (See subsection (5) for shipping of tangible personal property F.O.B. origin.)\n(b)1. Example: B is in the business of renting furniture and appliances. B rents a refrigerator to Customer C. B\u2019s policy is to allow customers to elect whether to pick up the rental property at B\u2019s place of business or to agree to a $25 delivery fee which B separately states on the customer\u2019s invoice. Since the separately stated $25 delivery fee could be avoided by a decision or action on the part of C, the $25 delivery fee is not subject to tax.\n2. Example: D is in the business of selling appliance repair parts. E desires to purchase a hot water heater element from D. D must order the hot water heater element for E from a wholesaler. D requires E to pay the transportation charges only if E elects to have the item shipped directly from the wholesaler to E\u2019s residence. E requests that D instruct the wholesaler to ship the hot water heater element directly to E\u2019s residence. Since the transportation charge is incurred at the election of E and could have been avoided by E, the invoice correctly excludes the transportation charge from the amount subject to tax as follows:\nWater Heater Element\t$25.00\nTotal Taxable Amount\t$25.00\nShipping and Handling Charges\t$3.25\n3.

Since the title to the property passes at the point of origin, transportation services arranged by the seller and rendered to the buyer are not a part of the taxable selling price, provided the transportation charges are separately stated. Where the transportation charges are billed by the seller to the buyer, but documentation is inadequate to establish the point at which title passes to the buyer, it is presumed that the tangible personal property was sold F.O.B. origin and the title to the property passes at the point of origin. In such instances, the transportation charges are not considered a part of the selling price of the property, if separately stated.\n(a) Example: Company B is in the business of selling large industrial type generators. Company B is located out-of-state. Due to the size and cost of the generators and the cost of delivery of the generators, Company B only sells the generators F.O.B. origin. Company C purchases a generator for $1 million for its own use and requests that the generator be shipped to Company C\u2019s location in Florida. Since the title to the equipment passes to Company C at Company B\u2019s location, no tax is due on any separately stated transportation charge.\n(b) Example: Company X is in the business of selling widgets at retail. Company X\u2019s customers may order the widgets to be shipped F.O.B. origin or F.O.B. destination. Customer Z places his order for a dozen widgets of various sizes to be shipped F.O.B. destination to his business location in Florida.

The producer is not required to obtain an exemption certificate from the purchaser to make tax exempt sales of agricultural products. This exemption does not apply to the sale of ornamental nursery stock.\n(b) Agricultural products that are produced by the farmer and used by the farmer or the farmer\u2019s family or employees on the farm are not subject to tax.\n(c) The sale of agricultural products by persons who do not produce agricultural products to any person who does not directly consume the product, but acquires the raw product for resale to the ultimate retail customer, or for use in the process of preparing, finishing, or manufacturing agricultural products for the ultimate retail consumer trade, is exempt. No certificate is required to be issued by the purchaser or obtained by the seller.\n(d) The sale of agricultural products by any person, other than the producer, as a marketable or finished product to the ultimate consumer, except in the form of food or food products, is subject to tax. Example: Marketable products, such as nursery stock, and finished products, such as hides, bones, hooves, and feathers, are subject to tax.\n(2)(a) The sale of ornamental nursery stock by any person, including producers of agricultural products, is subject to tax. The term \u201cornamental nursery stock\u201d applies to all plants, shrubs and trees customarily sold by nurseries for landscaping purposes, regardless of the state of growth or maturity, but does not include plants used to produce food for human consumption. Sod and ferns are examples of ornamental nursery stock.\n(b) The rental of ornamental nursery stock, such as plants, shrubs, or trees, is subject to tax, including the rental by the producer of the ornamental nursery stock.\n(c) A landscape contractor who purchases ornamental nursery stock to fulfill a lump sum, cost plus, fixed fee, or guaranteed price contract for the improvement of realty is construed to be the consumer of such nursery stock and is liable for the sales tax at the time of purchase. A person who fulfills a contract as above described should not collect the tax from his or her customers, because the tax should be paid by the landscaper on all materials used in fulfilling the contract. A landscaper who produces his or her own ornamental nursery stock or who obtains stock that was acquired without cost, such as by digging up wild plants in the woods, is not liable for the tax on such stock which he or she uses in fulfilling the aforesaid types of contracts.\n(d) A person who agrees by contract to sell specifically described and itemized materials and supplies at an agreed price or at the regular retail price and to complete the work either for an additional agreed price or on the basis of time consumed is deemed to be selling tangible personal property (ornamental nursery stock) at an agreed retail price. The contractor is required to collect sales tax from the purchaser based on the price of the materials and supplies, excluding any separately stated installation charges.

This rule governs the taxability of the purchase, sale, or use of tangible personal property by contractors and subcontractors who purchase, acquire, or manufacture materials and supplies for use in the performance of real property contracts other than public works contracts performed for governmental entities, which are governed by the provisions of Rule 12A-1.094, F.A.C. If a real property project involves multiple subcontractors, each subcontractor is responsible for paying, accruing, collecting, and remitting tax on his subcontract in accordance with this rule.\n(2) Definitions. For purposes of this rule, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(a) \u201cFabricated cost\u201d means the cost to a real property contractor of fabricated items, as defined in the following paragraph. The elements of cost included in fabricated cost are set forth in Rule 12A-1.043, F.A.C. Fabricated cost does not include the cost of transporting fabricated items from the contractor\u2019s plant to the job site or the cost of labor at the job site where the fabricated items are incorporated into the real property improvement.\n(b) \u201cFabricated items\u201d means items contractors manufacture, produce, process, compound, or fabricate for their own use in performing contracts for improvements to real property. The term applies only to items the contractor manufactures, produces, processes, compounds, or fabricates at a plant or shop maintained by the contractor. For this purpose, a temporary facility established at a job site that is used exclusively in connection with performing a contract for a real property improvement at that job site is not considered to be a plant or shop maintained by the contractor.\n(c)1. \u201cFixture\u201d means an item that is an accessory to a building, other structure, or to land, that retains its separate identity upon installation, but that is permanently attached to the realty. Fixtures include such items as wired lighting, kitchen or bathroom sinks, furnaces, central air conditioning units, elevators or escalators, or built-in cabinets, counters, or lockers.\n2. In order for an item to be considered a fixture, it is not necessary that the owner of the item also own the real property to which the item is attached. A retained title provision in a sales contract or in an agreement that is designated as a lease but is in substance a conditional sales contract is not determinative of whether the item involved is or is not a fixture.

Similarly, the fact that a lessee or licensee of real property rather than the lessor/owner enters into a contract for an item to be permanently attached to the real property does not prevent that item from being classified as a fixture.\n3. The determination whether an item is a fixture depends upon review of all the facts and circumstances of each situation. Among the relevant factors that determine whether a particular item is a fixture are the following:\na. The method of attachment. Items that are screwed or bolted in place, buried underground, installed behind walls, or joined directly to a structure\u2019s plumbing or wiring systems are likely to be classified as fixtures. Attachment in such a manner that removal is impossible without causing substantial damage to the underlying realty indicates that an item is a fixture.\nb. Intent of the property holder in having the item attached. If the property holder who causes an item to be attached to realty intends that the item will remain in place for an extended or indefinite period of time, that item is more likely to be a fixture. That intent may be determined by reviewing all of the property holder\u2019s actions in regard to the item, including how the item is treated for purposes of ad valorem and income tax purposes. For example, if a property owner reports the value of the item for purposes of ad valorem taxation of the realty and depreciates the item for tax and financial accounting purposes as real property, that indicates an intent that the property is permanently attached as a fixture.\nc. Real property law. If an interest in an item arises upon acquiring title to the land or building, the item is more likely to be considered a fixture. For example, if the seller of real property would be expected to leave an item behind when vacating the premises for a new owner without the contract specifically requiring that it be left, that item is likely to be classified as a fixture.\nd. Customization. If items are custom designed or custom assembled to be attached in a particular space, they are more likely to be classified as fixtures. Customization indicates intent that the items are to remain in place following installation.\ne. Permits and licensing. If installation of an item requires a construction permit or licensing of the contractor under statutes or regulations governing the building trades, that item is more likely to be regarded as a fixture.\nf. Legal agreements. The terms of any purchase agreement, deed, lease, or other legal document pertaining specifically to an item may be relevant in determining whether that item is a fixture of real property.\nThe foregoing list of factors relevant to determining whether an item is a fixture is intended to be illustrative only. Additional factors may exist in any particular case, and the weight to be given to the factors will also vary in each case.\n4. The term \u201cfixture\u201d does not include the following items, whether or not such items are attached to real property in a permanent manner:\na. Titled property.\nb. Machinery or equipment.\n(d) \u201cImprovement to real property\u201d or \u201creal property improvement\u201d includes the activities of building, erecting, constructing, altering, improving, repairing, or maintaining real property.\n(e)1. \u201cMachinery or equipment\u201d means and includes property that:\na.

Examples of items that are not machinery or equipment because they are integrated into the structure or realty and retain their usefulness no matter what activity is carried on at the site include heating and air conditioning system components or water heaters. Any property that would be classified as machinery or equipment under Section 212.08(5), F.S., or any other provision of Chapter 212, F.S., is considered to be machinery or equipment for purposes of this rule.

To physically apply materials and labor necessary to modify or change the characteristics of tangible personal property.\nThe terms do not include activities that do not result in any change in the character or quality of tangible personal property. For example, a repair or restoration of property to return it to its original state and level of functionality is not included within the defined activities.\n(g) \u201cReal property\u201d means land, improvements to land, and fixtures.

Erect, construct, alter, repair, or maintain any building, other structure, road, project, development, or other real property improvement;\nb. Excavate, grade, or perform site preparation for a building, other structure, road, project, development, or other real property improvement; or\nc. Furnish and install tangible personal property that becomes a part of or is directly wired or plumbed into the central heating system, central air conditioning system, electrical system, plumbing system, or other structural system that requires installation of wires, ducts, conduits, pipes, vents, or similar components that are embedded in or securely affixed to the land or a structure thereon.\n2. The term \u201creal property contract\u201d does not include:\na. A contract for the sale or for the sale and installation of tangible personal property such as machinery and equipment; or\nb. A contract to furnish tangible personal property that will be installed or affixed in such a way as to become a fixture or improvement to real property if the person furnishing the property has not also contracted to affix or install it.\n3. A contract is a real property contract if described in subparagraph 1. above, whether or not such agreement also involves providing property or services that would not be considered improvements to real property. See subsection (8) of this rule for discussion of such contracts.\n4. A contract contains the terms of the agreement between the contractor and the owner (or other interest holder) of the real property and is entered into in advance of any work being undertaken. A proposal prepared by a contractor prior to entering an agreement is not a contract. Statements, invoices, or other billings submitted after work has begun are not contracts.

The developer accepts the proposal. The parties enter into an agreement that requires the contractor to provide all the materials and labor necessary to supply the plumbing system for the project for a single lump sum price. When the work is completed, the contractor sends an invoice for the lump sum amount that shows a breakdown into materials and labor. Neither the proposal nor the invoice is a contract under which the developer agrees to pay separately for materials and labor. They are documents prepared by the contractor to explain or justify the price. The contract is the agreement between the parties that an entire installed plumbing system will be provided for a single lump sum.\n(i) \u201cTitled property\u201d means property that must be registered, licensed, titled, or documented by this state or by the United States, such as airplanes, boats, and motor vehicles. A houseboat, even if permanently docked and used as a primary residence, is not real property. Mobile homes are titled property unless they are assessed for ad valorem tax purposes as real property. Owners may report mobile homes as real property and have them assessed as such for ad valorem tax purposes. These mobile homes are issued special decals. Classification of a mobile home as personal property by a seller or a lender does not prohibit the owner of the mobile home from having the property assessed as real property. A mobile home that is issued a real property decal is treated as real property for purposes of this rule.\n(3) Classification of contracts by pricing. The taxability of purchases and sales by real property contractors is determined by the pricing arrangement in the contract. Contracts generally fall into one of the following categories:\n(a) Lump sum contracts. These are contracts in which a contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services for a single stated lump sum price.\n(b) Cost plus or fixed fee contracts. These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish the materials and supplies and necessary services in exchange for reimbursement of costs plus a fee that is fixed in advance or calculated as a percentage of the costs.\n(c) Upset or guaranteed price contracts. These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services based on costs plus fees but with an upset or guaranteed maximum price which may not be exceeded.\n(d) Retail sale plus installation contracts. These are contracts for improvements to real property in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to sell specifically described and itemized materials and supplies at an agreed price or at the regular retail price and to complete the work either for an additional agreed price or on the basis of time consumed. In order for a contract to fit in this category, all the materials that will be incorporated into the work must be itemized and priced in the contract before work begins. If a contract itemizes some materials but does not itemize other materials that will be incorporated into the work, the contract is not included in this category. Because the sale of the materials is a separable transaction from the installation, the purchaser must assume title to and risk of loss of the materials and supplies as they are delivered, rather than accepting title only to the completed work. The contractor may remain liable for negligence in handling and installing the items.\n(e) Time and materials contracts. These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services for a price that will be calculated as the sum of the contractor\u2019s cost or a marked up cost for materials to be used plus an amount for services to be based on the time spent performing the contract. These contracts are similar to cost plus or fixed fee contracts, because the final price to the property holder will be determined based on the cost of performance. A time and materials contract may or may not also have a guaranteed or upset price clause. Time and materials contracts differ from contracts described in paragraph (d), because the materials are not completely identified, itemized, and priced in the contract in advance and because the property owner", "start_char_idx": 1279612, "end_char_idx": 1284005, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3440e2ab-1020-44b3-a6d5-7bab51774793": {"__data__": {"id_": "3440e2ab-1020-44b3-a6d5-7bab51774793", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f514aca3-5e72-4e3b-b8be-8239da0db685", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8aff809ff24e1506155de4ee48f5d8ccbb751cfa8b0d4261269b8771e9cfb5da"}, "3": {"node_id": "6375436b-1b67-4887-8671-34861575f10c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0750a7d80fb26d2d5bc5258ac8ff0169ee2b0f129ca0bb65c8176a2b7a9c0fb9"}}, "hash": "d459332e6f6c7e7abce7236edee74eb0e1fb3d5af731cd95ebf31f1709f2478a", "text": "not completely identified, itemized, and priced in the contract in advance and because the property owner is contracting for a finished job rather than the purchase of materials.\n(4) General rule of taxability of real property contractors. Contractors are the ultimate consumers of materials and supplies they use to perform real property contracts and must pay tax on their costs of those materials and supplies, unless the contractor has entered a retail sale plus installation contract. Contractors performing only contracts described in paragraph (3)(a), (b), (c) or (e) do not resell the tangible personal property used to the real property owner but instead use the property themselves to provide the completed real property improvement. Such contractors should pay tax to their suppliers on all purchases. They should also pay tax on all materials they fabricate for their own use in performing such contracts, as discussed in subsection (10). They should charge no tax to their customers, regardless of whether they itemize charges for materials and labor in their proposals or invoices, because they are not engaged in selling tangible personal property. Such contractors should not register as dealers unless they are required to remit tax on the fabricated cost of items they fabricate to use in performing contracts.\n(5) Rule for paragraph (3)(d) contractors. Contractors who perform retail sale plus installation contracts described in paragraph (3)(d) do sell tangible personal property. They should register as dealers and provide a copy of their Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer to purchase tax exempt materials that are itemized and resold under paragraph (3)(d) contracts. They should not provide the certificate to purchase tax exempt items that they use themselves rather than reselling, such as hand tools, shop equipment, or office supplies. They must charge their customers\u2019 tax on the price paid for tangible personal property but not on the charges for installation labor. See Rule 12A-1.038, F.A.C., for tax exempt sales made to entities that hold a valid Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption.\n(6) Sales of tangible personal property. Contractors, manufacturers, or dealers who sell and install items of tangible personal property, including those enumerated in Rule 12A-1.016, F.A.C., must collect tax on the full selling price, including any installation or other charges, even though such charges may be separately stated. The items listed in Rule 12A-1.016, F.A.C., are tangible personal property even after installation, and their sale with installation is not classified as a real property contract. Contractors, manufacturers, or dealers who sell property over-the-counter without performing installation services must collect tax on the full sales price of such items, even though those items will become improvements to real property upon installation by the purchaser. At the point at which they are sold in over-the-counter transactions, those items are tangible personal property.\n(7) Repairs to machinery and equipment. Any owner or lessee that engages another to make repairs to or perform maintenance services on machinery and equipment that, because of its size, configuration, method of attachment, or other characteristics, has the appearance of real property, must inform the service provider that the machinery or equipment is tangible personal property. Unless the repair is exempt from taxation under Chapter 212, F.S., the owner or lessee should pay sales tax on the full price of the repair or maintenance to any service provider that is a registered dealer. If the service provider ordinarily operates as a real property contractor and is not a registered dealer, the owner or lessee must remit tax on the full price of the repair or maintenance directly to the state.\n(8) Mixed contracts. A real property contract may also include materials and labor that are not real property improvements. A contract that includes both real property work and tangible personal property is referred to in this subsection as a mixed contract. A mixed contract is not the same as a contract described in paragraph (3)(d) of this rule. Paragraph (3)(d) deals with a real property contract in which the contractor separately itemizes and prices all the materials that will be incorporated as part of the real property. A mixed contract is one that involves a real property improvement,", "start_char_idx": 1283984, "end_char_idx": 1288429, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6375436b-1b67-4887-8671-34861575f10c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6375436b-1b67-4887-8671-34861575f10c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3440e2ab-1020-44b3-a6d5-7bab51774793", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d459332e6f6c7e7abce7236edee74eb0e1fb3d5af731cd95ebf31f1709f2478a"}, "3": {"node_id": "cce128b0-4ffd-4780-9876-1a829143e21f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41c06deb0e0b2f2735eb8635a489570e2e4a3eb617fbcc0c2b22f18be3946777"}}, "hash": "0750a7d80fb26d2d5bc5258ac8ff0169ee2b0f129ca0bb65c8176a2b7a9c0fb9", "text": "of the real property. A mixed contract is one that involves a real property improvement, maintenance, or repair and also involves providing tangible personal property that remains tangible personal property and does not become part of the real property. In the case of a mixed contract, taxability depends upon the predominant nature of the work performed under the contract and upon the contract terms.\n(a) If the predominant nature of a mixed contract is a contract for real property improvements, taxability will be determined as if the contract were entirely for real property. For example, a residential developer routinely provides some items of tangible personal property, such as free standing appliances, with new homes sold under cost-plus contracts. The predominant nature of the contract is for a dwelling. The developer should pay sales or use tax on the appliances. A contractor constructs a factory under a turnkey contract that includes providing and installing machinery and equipment that is not exempt from sales and use tax. The contract is predominantly for a factory, a real property improvement, and the contractor should pay use tax on the cost of the machinery and equipment. No tax is collected from the property owner in either case, even though some tangible personal property is included in the project.\n(b) If the predominant nature of a mixed contract is a contract for tangible personal property, taxability of the contract will be determined as if the contract were entirely for tangible personal property. For example, a vendor of a mechanical conveyor system for a warehouse provides reinforced concrete foundations and embeds steel plates in the concrete to permit installation of the equipment by bolting it to the plates. The contract is predominantly for the sale of equipment. The contractor should buy the equipment, concrete, and steel plates tax exempt by extending a copy of the contactor\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer and charge tax on the full price charged to the customer.\n(c) The determination of the predominant nature of a contract will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Consideration will be given to the description of the project and the responsibilities of the contractor as set forth in the contract. Consideration will also be given to the relative cost of performance of the real property and tangible personal property components of the contract.\n(d) If a mixed contract clearly allocates the contract price among the various elements of the contract, and such allocation is bona fide and reasonable in terms of the costs of materials and nature of the work to be performed, taxation will be in accordance with the allocation. For example, a residential developer builds and sells a home on a cost plus basis, but the contract provides separately stated prices for the sale and installation of certain optional free standing appliances that are tangible personal property and are not classified as real property fixtures. The contractor may purchase those appliances by issuing a copy of the contractor\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer and charge sales tax on the price paid for the appliances, including installation, by the home buyer. The contractor is responsible for paying tax on all the materials that are included in the cost plus price of the home, other than the separately itemized appliances. Similarly, a manufacturer who sells and installs a mechanical conveyor system in a warehouse could state a separate charge in the contract for providing reinforced concrete with embedded steel plates in the warehouse floor to support the conveyor. The conveyor system is machinery or equipment and is therefore tangible personal property. The concrete and plates would be considered a real property improvement. The contractor should pay tax on the materials used for the real property part of the contract and not charge tax to the customer on the related charge. The customer should pay tax on the rest of the contract price allocable to the conveyor machinery itself.\n(e) This subsection does not affect any exemption provided in Chapter 212, F.S., for machinery or equipment that may be claimed by a contractor based on a temporary tax exemption permit, affidavit, or other authorized certification by the owner of real property.

For example, purchases of certain equipment for generating electrical power or of certain machinery for manufacturing tangible personal property for sale are exempt from sales and use taxes. In order for the property owner to receive the benefit of these exemptions, it has been specifically provided that contractors who purchase and install the exempt items may claim the exemption based on the property owner\u2019s providing the required documentation of entitlement. The guidelines on mixed contracts are not intended to impact these exemptions. In the case of a mixed contract that is treated as a real property contract, the contractor is still entitled to purchase the qualified equipment or machinery tax-exempt. In the case of a mixed contract treated as a sale of tangible personal property, the contractor would purchase the equipment or machinery by issuing a copy of the contractor\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer and accept the property owner\u2019s authorized documentation of exemption in lieu of charging tax on the subsequent sale of the equipment or machinery to the property owner. See Rule 12A-1.038, F.A.C., for tax exempt sales made to entities that hold a valid Consumer\u2019s Certificate of Exemption.\n(9) Dual operators. Some contractors both use materials themselves in the performance of contracts and resell materials either in over-the-counter sales or under contracts described in paragraph (3)(d). Those contractors should register as dealers. When they purchase materials that they may either use themselves or that they may resell, they may issue a copy of the contractor\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer. Florida tax should be remitted when a subsequent event determines the appropriate taxation of the materials. If the materials are subsequently resold, tax should be collected from the buyer and remitted to the state. If the materials are used by the contractor, use tax should be paid to the state instead.\n(10) Use tax on fabrication costs. Contractors may maintain shops, plants, or similar facilities where they manufacture, produce, compound, process, or fabricate items for their own use in performing contracts. Contractors are required to pay use tax on the fabricated cost of those items. The elements that must be included in the taxable cost of such items are set forth in Rule 12A-1.043, F.A.C. In the case of real property contractors, the taxable cost of an item manufactured, produced, compounded, processed, or fabricated for use in performing a contract does not include labor that occurs at the job site where the item will be incorporated into a real property improvement or transportation from the plant where an item was fabricated to the job site. Examples of real property contractors who are subject to tax under this subsection include cabinet contractors who build custom cabinets in their shops, roofing contractors who operate tile plants, or heating/air conditioning/ventilation contractors who maintain sheet metal shops for making ductwork. Real property contractors that are required to remit use tax on fabricated items must register as dealers for purposes of remitting such tax if they are not already registered as dual operators.\n(11) Percent of contract price method.\n(a) The Department is authorized to adopt rules that establish an elective percent of contract price method for calculating use tax obligations of real property contractors that manufacture, produce, compound, process, or fabricate tangible personal property for their own use in performing contracts. For example, a rule could be adopted to provide that cabinet makers that build cabinets at their own shops and install them could elect to pay use tax on a certain percentage of the contract price paid by the real property holder, rather than keeping track of the elements of taxable cost of the fabricated cabinets.\n(b) In order to initiate a rulemaking project to adopt the percent of contract price method for an industry group, the Department must receive a petition from the majority of the members of the group or from a statewide association representing the group. The petition must be accompanied by a proposal setting forth the percent of contract price the group believes should be adopted in the rule and by sufficient information and documentation to establish that the proposed percentage is based on", "start_char_idx": 1292904, "end_char_idx": 1297323, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fda7544-8be2-439c-b80c-4baec56eebb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fda7544-8be2-439c-b80c-4baec56eebb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "cce128b0-4ffd-4780-9876-1a829143e21f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41c06deb0e0b2f2735eb8635a489570e2e4a3eb617fbcc0c2b22f18be3946777"}, "3": {"node_id": "b31056a6-98d7-4261-bb7a-d8365c4e3dda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "913ebd0f3116f376f245c27e17b378f8df7de8b77d392be877019973d786d8b0"}}, "hash": "031220711e0707e450212f49181cb0f91c969be5563bce7e1b65e13cc275d554", "text": "the rule and by sufficient information and documentation to establish that the proposed percentage is based on the taxable costs incurred by members of the petitioning group. The industry group may propose alternative percentages for members of the group who are registered dealers and do not pay tax on purchases of direct materials that are incorporated into fabricated items and for members of the group who pay sales tax on those purchases. The Department will consider the information supplied with the petition, as well as any other relevant information that is available. Petitions should be submitted to Department of Revenue, Agency Clerk, Post Office Box 6668, Tallahassee, Florida 32314-6668.\n(c) The Department will review rules adopted at the petition of industry groups and amend them to adjust the percentage to insure it continues to reflect the taxable costs for that industry group. The percentage of contract price established in a rule described in this subsection can not be amended during the first five years after its adoption. After that time, the Department will review and, if the taxable costs of the industry group are no longer accurately reflected by the percentage provided, amend the rule. All such reviews must be at least five years apart. In conducting a review, the Department will consider any information submitted by the industry group affected, as well as any other available information.\n(d) If the Department adopts a percent of contract price rule for an industry group, members of that group may elect to apply the method on a contract-by-contract basis or to apply it to all contracts in any period by timely accruing and remitting tax using the method. Timely accrual and remittance means accrual as of the time invoices are issued based on applying the established percentage to the amount invoiced to calculate the taxable cost and remittance with a timely filed return filed in the reporting period immediately after the accrual (i.e., in the month following the issuance of the invoice and accrual of the tax for a contractor who is required to file on the regular monthly schedule). The contractor must maintain records to document the timely accrual and payment of the tax on each contract for which the method is used.\n(e) Application of the established percentage to the contract price is intended to capture the taxable cost of fabricated items used in performing the contract. If the contractor pays sales tax on purchases of materials incorporated into the fabricated items, the use tax due on the fabricated cost under the percent of contract method should be reduced to reflect the tax already paid on those materials. For example, a real property contractor who fabricates some of the items used in performing contracts is entitled by rule to use a 50% of contract price method to compute use tax on fabricated cost. The contractor agrees to fabricate and install items for a lump sum price of $10,000. The contractor pays sales tax on all purchases of materials and supplies. The cost of materials incorporated into the fabricated items for the contract is $3,000, on which the contractor has already paid $180 ($3,000 x 6%) in sales tax to the supplier. Those materials costs on which tax has already been paid are subtracted from the taxable percentage of the contract price before calculating the use tax due on the finished item. The use tax to be accrued and remitted under the percent of contract method is $120 (50% of $10,000 = $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000 x 6% = $120).\n(f) Use of the percent of contract price method applies only to the use tax owed on fabricated items. Other taxes may also be owed in connection with performance of a contract. For example, a real property contractor who fabricates some of the items used in performing contracts is entitled by rule to use a 50% of contract price method to compute use tax on fabricated cost. The contractor agrees to fabricate items, install those items, and supply materials and labor for on-site work that does not require shop fabrication. The contract is for a lump sum price of $10,000.

The cost of materials used for the on-site work is $1,000. Use tax must be remitted on 50% of the contract price for the fabricated items and on $1,000 for the on-site materials. The total tax owed is $360 ($5,000 + $1,000 = $6,000 x 6% = $360).\n(g) The percent of contract price method involves an alternative way to calculate the use tax owed and alternative timing for accrual and payment of tax. It does not change the nature of the tax liability. The tax involved is still a use tax on fabricated cost. It is not a tax on the income earned from contracts. Election of the method, therefore, does not affect the jurisdiction where the tax is owed.\n(12) Asphalt contractors. Contractors that manufacture asphalt for their own use in the performance of improving real property must calculate the tax on that asphalt based on the sum of the following:\n(a) The cost of materials that become a component part or that are an ingredient of the finished asphalt multiplied by 6%; plus,\n(b) The costs of transportation of such components and ingredients to the plant site multiplied by 6%; plus,\n(c) An indexed tax per ton representing all other costs associated with the manufacture of the asphalt.\nIf sales tax has been paid on the purchase of materials or transportation in paragraph (a) or (b) above, the cost of such materials or transportation is not included in computing the total use tax due. The indexed tax is computed based on the \u201cmaterials and components for construction\u201d series of the producer price index, as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics. The indexed tax is revised annually, effective each July 1. The Department is responsible for publishing the new rate each year in time to permit timely accruals and payment of use tax by asphalt contractors.\n(13) Use tax on rock, shell, fill dirt, or similar materials. A real property contractor is taxable on the cost of rock, shell, fill dirt, or similar materials the contractor uses to perform a real property contract for another person.\n(a) If the contractor acquires the materials from a location the contractor owns or leases, the contractor must remit use tax based on one of the following methods:\n1. The fair retail market value, which means either the price the contractor would have to pay on the open market or the price at which the contractor would sell the materials to third parties; or\n2. The cost of the land plus all costs of clearing, excavating, and loading the materials, including labor, power, blasting, and similar costs.\n(b) If the contractor purchases the materials and as part of the agreement excavates and removes them from the seller\u2019s land (including state-owned submerged land), the taxable cost is the purchase price paid to the seller plus all the costs incurred by the contractor in clearing, excavating, and removing the materials, including labor.\n(c) When rock, shell, fill dirt, or similar materials are secured from a location owned by the contractor for use on his or her own property, the contractor does not owe tax on these materials. For purposes of this paragraph, a contractor that is a corporation is considered to own any location that is owned by any corporation in the same affiliated group as the contractor. \u201cAffiliated group\u201d shall have the meaning provided in Section 220.03(1), F.S.\n(d) A contractor on a road project owes no tax on borrow materials that are provided at no charge by the Department of Transportation, including materials extracted from pits that are provided at no charge by that department.\n(14) Mobile homes. A contractor who makes improvements or repairs to a mobile home is required to ascertain the status of that home as real property or as tangible personal property to determine how tax should be paid. If the mobile home has a real property decal, the contract should be treated as a real property contract.

If the mobile home does not have a real property decal, improvements or repairs are generally treated as contracts to improve or repair tangible personal property. The contractor should charge tax on the full price paid by the customer, including charges for labor. In that case, the contractor is not subject to tax on the materials that are incorporated into and become a part of the improvement or repair of the mobile home. Upon initial installation of a mobile home, classification is dependent on the method of installation and whether title to the land and the mobile home are held by the same person. See Rule 12A-1.007, F.A.C., for further discussion on the taxation of contracts involving mobile homes.\n(15) Contracts performed for nongovernmental tax-exempt entities. Contractors who perform lump sum, cost-plus, guaranteed price, or time and materials contracts for nongovernmental entities that are exempt from sales taxes, such as private schools, hospitals, or churches, are taxable on materials the contractor purchases for use in performing those contracts. Such contractors are not permitted to use the consumer\u2019s certificate of exemption issued to the exempt entity in order to purchase materials for the contract exempt from taxes. The entity\u2019s exempt status is not relevant, because it applies only to sales of tangible personal property to the entity, not to the contractor. The contractor, not the exempt entity, is the taxable consumer of the materials the contractor purchases to use in performing that contract. The fact that an exempt entity will bear the economic burden of the taxes paid by the contractor in the form of a higher contract price does not change the contractor\u2019s tax liabilities.\n(16) Subdivision and similar improvements.\n(a) Subdivision owners and developers or their contractors are subject to tax on purchases of materials for use in the construction of streets, roadways, water distribution systems, sewers, and similar improvements that the owner or developer subsequently transfers to a municipality or other governmental unit. These transfers are not donations or sales of tangible personal property to a governmental unit.\n(b) If a municipality or other governmental unit purchases and installs water mains and distribution pipes for a property owner, including a subdivision developer, under an arrangement whereby the municipality retains ownership, possession, and control of the mains and pipes, but recovers all or part of its cost from the property owner through the collection of an installation charge, such installation charge is equivalent to an assessment for benefits. It is not taxable.\n(17) Specific activities classified as real property contracts. Contractors who are engaged in the following activities are generally considered to be real property contractors, although any particular job may be determined not to involve an improvement to real property:\n(a) Awning installation;\n(b) Block, brick, and stone masonry;\n(c) Bridge construction;\n(d) Burglar and fire alarm system installation;\n(e) Cabinetry (built-in only);\n(f) Carpentry;\n(g) Carpeting installed with tacks, glue, or other permanent means and serving as the finished floor;\n(h) Cement and concrete work;\n(i) Closet system installation;\n(j) Dock, pier, seawall, and similar construction, maintenance, or repair;\n(k) Door and window installation or on-site repair;\n(l) Driveway installation or repair;\n(m) Electrical system installation and repairs, including structural wiring and cabling, meter boxes, switches, receptacles, wall plates, and similar items;\n(n) Elevator and escalator installation and maintenance;\n(o) Fencing and gates installation intended for permanent use;\n(p) Flooring;\n(q) Foundations;\n(r) Glass and mirror installation if installed in a permanent manner;\n(s) Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system work;\n(t) Insulation of structures or structural components;\n(u) Iron work, such as railings,", "start_char_idx": 1305709, "end_char_idx": 1309748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b4b7924-28fc-4125-9b28-de98ecc8972b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b4b7924-28fc-4125-9b28-de98ecc8972b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf3d9208-eb54-4f7d-b50e-f2c42757cf7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bce0fd843267e841613e83eba05b8784df9988139d6cd067fbde257688105631"}, "3": {"node_id": "77e481e4-17da-4a36-9673-3e968bd44593", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cdfd0a97e751172dc0b1b1e4260cf8c9278407849c43cd52d428535c106b21f6"}}, "hash": "a22240125fcffb46faac8132b2eaa100551cf1c7183b164d604df8c64a051956", "text": "structures or structural components;\n(u) Iron work, such as railings, banisters, and stairs, incorporated into buildings;\n(v) Landscaping work, including walls, walkways, permanent structures such as greenhouses, arbors, or gazebos, and permanent plantings such as trees, perennial shrubs, and lawns;\n(w) Lathing;\n(x) Painting of buildings, decks, and other real property structures;\n(y) Paving and surfacing work, including driveways, parking lots, patios, roadwork, and sidewalks;\n(z) Plastering;\n(aa) Plumbing work;\n(bb) Radio and telephone transmission towers;\n(cc) Roofing work;\n(dd) Septic tank installation or maintenance;\n(ee) Sheet metal/ductwork;\n(ff) Siding installation;\n(gg) Site work, including clearing, grading, demolition, and excavation;\n(hh) Signs that are permanently attached to realty;\n(ii) Solar systems;\n(jj) Sprinkler system installation for lawn and garden irrigation or for fire prevention;\n(kk) Stucco;\n(ll) Structural steel and concrete installation;\n(mm) Swimming pool installation, including accessories and parts that are permanently attached or are plumbed or wired into plumbing or electrical systems;\n(nn) Tile work;\n(oo) Utility poles and lines installation and maintenance;\n(pp) Wallpaper installation;\n(qq) Water, sewer, and drainage systems;\n(rr) Waterproofing of structures, decks, driveways, and other real property components; and,\n(ss) Well drilling and installation.\nThe determination whether any particular job involves a contract for an improvement to real property will be based on the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of subsection (2).\n(18) Specific activities not classified as real property contracts.

The sale of electric power or energy for use in residential households, to owners of residential models, or to licensed family day care homes by utilities who are required to pay the gross receipts tax imposed by subparagraph 203.01(1)(a)1., F.S., is exempt. Also exempt is electric power or energy sold by such utilities and used in the common areas of apartment houses, cooperatives, and condominiums, in residential facilities enumerated in Chapters 400 and 429, F.S., and in other residential facilities. However, if any part of the electric power or energy is used for a non-exempt purpose, the entire sale is subject to tax.\n(b) An electric utility is not obligated to collect and remit tax on any sale of electric power or energy when:\n1. The electric power or energy is sold at a rate based on the utility\u2019s \u201cresidential schedule,\u201d under tariffs filed by the utility with the Public Service Commission; or\n2. The utility has on file a writing or document evidencing a representation of the utility\u2019s customer that the electric power or energy is being purchased for residential household use, including licensed family day care homes and other facilities identified in paragraph (a). The writing or document may be a customer application or a certificate that identifies the customer as purchasing the electric power or energy for a residential purpose. A \u201ccustomer application\u201d includes a record of information obtained electronically or orally from the customer in the ordinary course of business. The electric utility must have acted in good faith in accepting the representation of the customer.\n(c) Tax is due on electric power or energy purchased by a customer tax exempt for the claimed purposes of residential household use that does not qualify for such exemption. In such instances, if the electric utility complies with the requirements of paragraph (b), the Department will look to the customer for any applicable tax, penalty, or interest due. The Department will look to the utility for any applicable tax, penalty, or interest due when the electric utility\u2019s books and records indicate a failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b).\n(2) All fuels used by public or private utilities, including municipal corporations and rural cooperative associations in the generation of electric power or energy for sale are exempt.\n(3) Private or public utilities or rural electric cooperative associations are required to pay use tax based on the cost of electric power or energy used by them.\nCross Reference: Rule 12A-1.022, F.A.C., for guidelines on federal excise taxes, gross receipts tax, and other fees.\n(4) See Rule 12A-1.087, F.A.C., for requirements to claim the exemption for electricity used for the production or processing of agricultural farm products on a farm.\nRulemaking Authority 212.18(2), 213.06(1) FS.

Except as provided in Rule Chapter 12-24, and Rules 12A-1.005 and 12A-1.070, F.A.C., and this rule, all taxes required under Chapter 212, F.S., to be collected or paid in any month, are due to the Department on the first day of the month following the date of sale or transaction. The payment and return must be delivered to the Department or be postmarked on or before the 20th day of the month following the date of sale or transaction for a dealer to be entitled to the collection allowance and to avoid penalty and interest for late filing. If the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, payments accompanied by returns will be accepted as timely if postmarked or delivered to the Department on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this rule, a legal holiday means a holiday that is observed by federal or state agencies as a legal holiday as this term is defined in Chapter 683, F.S., and s. 7503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A \u201clegal holiday\u201d pursuant to s. 7503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia or a statewide legal holiday at a location outside the District of Columbia but within an internal revenue district.\n(b) When quarterly, semiannual, or annual reporting is authorized by the Department pursuant to Section 212.11(1)(c) or (d), F.S., the tax is due the first day of the month following the authorized reporting period and becomes delinquent on the 21st day of that month.\n(c) Quarterly, semiannual, or annual filers that remit an excessive tax payment for the period July 1 through June 30 which represents a nonrecurring business activity can request to continue to file their returns quarterly, semiannual, or annually by submitting a written request to the Florida Department of Revenue, Account Management, P.O. Box 6480, Tallahassee, Florida 32314-6480. When a dealer makes a written request to continue on the same filing frequency, the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee will determine whether the dealer\u2019s request is based on a nonrecurring business activity, based upon the facts of each case, using the following guidelines:\n1. The type of activity. The type of activity, as opposed to the level of activity, that makes that dealer\u2019s remittance unusual for its particular business.\n2. The focus of the dealer\u2019s business. A change in the dealer\u2019s business focus will not be considered nonrecurring business activity.\n3. The number of occurrences. When the dealer\u2019s remittance amount continues to exceed the maximum amount allowed for a quarterly, semiannual, or annual filing frequency, the remittance will not be considered nonrecurring.\n4. Regularity.

In such cases, for the privilege of deviating from the requirement of subsection (1) above, a dealer shall remit tax in accordance with one of the methods outlined below, and the dealer\u2019s records must substantiate the method so elected.\n(a) When the public has not been put on notice through the posting of price lists or signs prominently displayed throughout the establishment that the tax is included in the total charge, package stores which sell no mixed drinks shall remit tax at rate of 6.35 percent of their total receipts.

The applicant has no permanent, licensed place of business in this state; and,\n2. The applicant does not make retail sales within this state.\n(e) For purposes of this rule, a \u201cplace of business\u201d is a location where a dealer engages in an activity or activities described in this subsection. A place of business includes the entire contiguous area in which the dealer carries on an activity or activities that require registration. A dealer that engages in more than one activity requiring registration within a contiguous area generally is required to obtain only one registration certificate for that location. The Department will, however, treat areas within a single contiguous location as separate places of business and require a dealer to obtain separate registration certificates if the activities carried on in those areas are subject to taxation under different provisions of Chapter 212, F.S., the activities are not functionally related, and the efficient administration of the taxes imposed by Chapter 212, F.S., is facilitated by multiple registrations. The Department will permit a dealer to obtain separate registrations for activities carried on at a single contiguous location at the dealer\u2019s request if the dealer keeps separate financial records for the activities and the activities are not functionally related. Under no circumstances will a dealer be subject to more than one penalty for failure or refusal to obtain a registration certificate for a single contiguous location, even if the dealer could be required or permitted to obtain separate registration certificates for multiple activities carried on at the location. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule in determining whether more than one place of business exists at a single contiguous location.\n1. A taxpayer operates a shopping mall with 100 retail outlets that are leased to stores and restaurants, parking and common areas, and offices where management and accounting functions are performed. The taxpayer is required to register as a dealer because the rental of real property to the retailers is taxable under Section 212.031, F.S. The entire shopping mall is a single place of business for purposes of registration by the taxpayer.\n2. A taxpayer owns a parcel of land with a building and a parking area. The building is divided into three areas. In one area, the taxpayer operates a retail building supply store. In the second area, which has a separate customer entrance, the taxpayer operates a retail store where custom furniture is made and sold. The third area in the building is used as warehouse and office space serving both stores. When ordering inventory, taxpayer combines orders of lumber, hardware, paints, and stains from suppliers for the building supply store and for the furniture store. All inventory is purchased for resale and no records are maintained of whether materials are sold in the building supply store or incorporated into furniture for sale in the furniture store. The taxpayer records sales for both activities in the same accounting records. The parcel of land and the building are a single place of business for registration purposes.

A taxpayer owns a parcel of land with a building and a parking area. The building is divided into three areas. In one area, the taxpayer operates a retail building supply store. In the second area, which has a separate customer entrance, the taxpayer operates a retail store where custom clothing is made and sold. The third area in the building is used as warehouse and office space serving both stores. Separate sales and other accounting records are maintained for the two stores.

In addition to amusement rides, the park facilities include restaurants and a gift shop operated by the taxpayer and concession stands throughout the park where concessionaires sell snacks and beverages.

The taxpayer orders food for all its restaurants and other materials and supplies on combined purchase orders, regardless of where in the park and hotel complex the food, materials, or supplies will be used. Employees may be assigned to work anywhere throughout the entire park and hotel complex as needed. The taxpayer treats the entire complex as a single business for purposes of financial accounting. The taxpayer would be entitled to treat the entire tract of land with amusement park and hotel facility as a single place of business for registration purposes. Even though the taxpayer\u2019s activities are taxable pursuant to several different sections of Chapter 212, F.S., all of the activities are functionally related parts of a single tourism/resort business under the taxpayer\u2019s operational methods and accounting practices.\n5.

A taxpayer owns a large tract of land. The taxpayer operates an amusement park on part of the land. The taxpayer charges admission for entrance to the park. In addition to amusement rides, the park facilities include restaurants and a gift shop operated by the taxpayer, concession stands throughout the park where concessionaires sell snacks and beverages, and maintenance and storage buildings. The taxpayer manages the amusement park activities, including purchasing and payroll functions from taxpayer\u2019s corporate headquarters in another city. The taxpayer also owns a resort hotel adjacent to the amusement park on the same tract of land. The hotel contains several restaurants and retail stores that are leased to other merchants. Because of its proximity to the park, the hotel caters primarily to park visitors. The taxpayer has entered into a management agreement with a third party management company. The management company is responsible, under its contract with the taxpayer, for all aspects of operating the hotel, including purchasing, paying suppliers, personnel, leasing retail stores to merchants, financial record keeping, and tax matters. The management company collects sales taxes in regard to the hotel operations and remits those taxes on taxpayer\u2019s behalf to the state. All records in regard to the hotel operations are maintained by the management company at the hotel premises. The taxpayer will be required to treat the amusement park and the hotel as separate places of business. The two activities are not functionally related in terms of operations or accounting. In addition, because a separate return will be prepared and filed for the hotel operations, it will facilitate administration of Chapter 212, F.S., if a separate registration and reporting number is assigned.\n7. A taxpayer operates a manufacturing facility and a retail outlet on the same tract of land. Statutes have been enacted to provide sales and use tax exemptions to businesses manufacturing the type of product the taxpayer manufactures. Those statutes require the department to make annual reports to the legislature and the office of the governor on the volume of sales made by manufacturers claiming the exemption. The department will require separate registration of the manufacturing business to facilitate compiling the required annual report.\n(2) How to register as a dealer.\n(a) Registration with the Department for the purposes of sales and use tax is available by using one of the following methods:\n1.

When the Department requires a person applying for a new certificate of registration to post security, the following criteria will be used to determine the amount required, unless the specific facts and circumstances warrant a higher amount not to exceed the sum of the person\u2019s total estimated tax or fee liability, as determined by the Department, for twelve calendar months, plus the person\u2019s outstanding tax or fee liability:\na. If the person is or will be:\n(I) A monthly filer, security equal to six months\u2019 estimated tax or fee liability will be required.\n(II) A quarterly filer, security equal to nine months\u2019 estimated tax or fee liability will be required.\n(III) A semiannual or annual filer, security equal to one year of the estimated tax or fee liability will be required.\nb.

When the Department determines that security is required as a condition to obtaining a dealer\u2019s certificate of registration, it will send written notice of intent to deny registration to the person at the person\u2019s last known address as it appears in the Department\u2019s records. When the Department determines that security is required as a condition to retaining a dealer\u2019s certificate of registration, it will send a notice of intent to revoke registration to the person at the person\u2019s last known address as it appears in the Department\u2019s records. The person must either post security or send a written request for a conference to the Department. The security or written request for a conference must be received by the Department within 30 consecutive calendar days after the date of the notice.\n2.a.

An irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond must contain a provision that requires the issuing bank or surety company to notify the Department of the expiration or termination of the irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond by certified mail at least 60 days prior to the expiration or termination.\n8. If security is still required under this subsection and an irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond expires or is terminated without substitution, the Department will revoke the applicable person\u2019s existing certificate and request that the Department of Legal Affairs proceed by injunction to prevent such person from doing business in the state until substitute security is posted.\n9. No interest will be paid by the state to any person for the deposit of any security under this subsection.\n(e) Insufficiency of Security. If the Department determines that the amount of any existing security is insufficient to ensure payment of the amount of the tax or fee liability, penalties, and interest for which the person is or may become liable, or if the amount of the security is reduced or released whether by judgment rendered or by use of the security to pay the delinquent tax or fee liability, penalties, or interest, the Department will provide written notification to the person of the revised amount of security required. The person is required to file an additional security in the amount required by the Department, or request a conference within 30 consecutive calendar days, failing which the Department will revoke any existing registration. If a new security is furnished, the Department, as appropriate, will cancel, surrender, or discharge the previous security, for which the new security is substituted.\n(f) Security Duration. If the person complies with its tax or fee liability for a period of twelve consecutive months, upon written request, the Department will release the surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit.

This list is not intended to be an exhaustive list.\n(b) \u201cConsumables\u201d means tangible personal property that is used, consumed, or expended by guests or tenants when occupying transient accommodations, such as soap, toilet paper, tissues, shower caps, shaving kits, shoe mitts, shampoo, lotions, mouthwash, matches, laundry bags, swimming suit wrappers, pens, stationery, calendars, toothpaste, toothbrushes, newspapers, postcards, guides for guests, books, mints, travel packets, and sewing kits.

Any waiver of a charge or surcharge to an individual guest or tenant is considered an adjustment to the rental charges or room rates for transient accommodations.\n4.a. Example: A guest rents a room in a resort hotel that charges each guest a $5 resort fee to receive daily newspapers and use of its health club facilities. When a guest objects to the fee, the hotel will waive the fee for that individual guest. All guests receive the newspaper and may use the health club facilities, whether or not the guest pays the fee. The $5 resort fee charged by the resort hotel to its guests is included in the room rates subject to tax. When the resort hotel waives the fee for an individual guest, the waiver of the fee is considered an adjustment to the room rate.\nb. Example: A guest rents a beach cottage for three months. The owner of the cottage requires the cottage to be cleaned by Company X and separately itemizes the cleaning services on the guest\u2019s bill. Because the charges for the cleaning services provided by Company X are required to be paid as a condition for the right to use the beach cottage, the charges are included in the rental charges and are subject to tax. The charges are subject to tax even though the cleaning services are provided by a third party and the charges are separately stated on the guest\u2019s bill.\nc. Example: A guest rents a condominium unit from the unit owner for two weeks. If a guest wants daily cleaning services, the owner will arrange for these services, but does not require the guest to purchase the additional services. The unit owner separately itemizes the additional maid services on the guest\u2019s bill. Because the additional maid services are not a requirement for the right to use the condominium unit and the guest does not receive the services without payment for the services, the charges are not included in the amount of taxable rental charges.\n(c)1. Rental charges or room rates include any charge or surcharge to a guest or tenant for gratuities, tips, or similar charges except when:\na.

The purchase of these items and services is not subject to the tourist development tax, as provided in Section 125.0104, F.S., the tourist impact tax, as provided in Section 125.0108, F.S., or the convention development taxes, as provided in Section 212.0305, F.S.\n(b) Owners or owners\u2019 representatives may purchase or lease tangible personal property without paying tax only when the taxable property is:\n1.

Deposits or prepayments that are required to be paid to secure a potential guest or tenant the right to rent, lease, let, or license a transient accommodation by a time certain. Such deposits do not guarantee the transient guest or tenant the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of transient accommodations.\nb. Example: A potential tenant reserves a beach house for a specific week from a management company. The management company requires a $100 reservation deposit to hold the beach house until a time certain, such as 6:00 p.m., the first night of the reserved week. The tenant is unable to use the beach house for the reserved week, but fails to cancel the reservation with the management company. The management company retains the $100 deposit. Because the $100 charge does not provide the tenant the right to the use of the beach house, the $100 deposit is not subject to tax.\nc. Example: A potential guest makes reservations at a hotel for a designated night. The hotel requires a deposit equal to the room rate to hold a room until a time certain, such as 6:00 p.m., on the designated night. The guest does not arrive at the hotel and fails to cancel the reservation. The hotel retains the deposit. Because payment of the deposit did not provide the potential guest the right to the use of the room and the hotel did not collect any tax from the potential guest, the room deposit is not subject to tax.\n2.a. Security deposits that are refundable at the expiration of any agreement for the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of a transient accommodation, unless the security deposits are withheld by the owner or owner\u2019s representative and applied to unpaid rental charges or room rates at the expiration of the agreement.\nb. \u201cSecurity Deposits,\u201d for purposes of this rule, means any refundable deposit by any guest or tenant with the owner or owner\u2019s representative of transient accommodations as security for full and faithful performance by the guest or tenant of the terms of any agreement for the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of a transient accommodation, including damages to the accommodation.

Example: To lease an apartment for three months, the owner requires the tenant to pay a security deposit equal to one month\u2019s rental charge. The apartment is damaged during the lease period, and the security deposit is retained by the owner at the end of the rental period. The security deposit is not subject to tax when collected, or when retained at the end of the rental period, by the owner.\n(b) Rental charges or room rates include deposits or prepayments that guarantee the guest or tenant the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of transient accommodations during a specified rental period under the provisions of an agreement with the owner or owner\u2019s representative of transient accommodations. The owner or owner\u2019s representative is required to provide transient accommodations to any guest or tenant that enters into such an agreement and pays the required prepayment or deposit, even when the guest or tenant does not occupy the accommodation.\n1. Example: A potential tenant enters into an agreement with the owner of a condominium unit to reserve the unit for a specified week. In exchange for the required deposit, the tenant is guaranteed that the unit will be available for use during the specified week. The tenant is permitted to cancel the reservations and receive a full refund of the required deposit provided that the cancellation is received 48 hours prior to the scheduled arrival date. The tenant makes the required prepayment by issuing a credit card authorization for the amount of the weekly rental charges. Even though the tenant is unable to use the unit during the specified week, the tenant fails to cancel the reservation. The condominium owner charges the tenant\u2019s credit card for the unit. The weekly rental charges paid by the tenant for the condominium unit is subject to tax, even though the tenant does not use the unit.\n2. Example: A hotel guarantees that it will provide room accommodations on a designated date to potential guests that make reservations and pay a required room deposit. To receive a refund of the required room deposit, the potential guest must cancel his or her reservations by 4:00 p.m. of the designated date. A potential guest that has made reservations and has paid the required room deposit fails to cancel the reservations and fails to arrive at the hotel on the designated date to use the reserved room accommodations. Because the potential guest fails to cancel the reservations, the guest forfeits the room deposit. Even though the guest did not occupy a room at the hotel, the forfeited room deposit is subject to tax.\n(c) Deposits or prepayments that are held by the owner or owner\u2019s representative and subsequently used to offset or reduce a guest\u2019s or tenant\u2019s rental charges or room rates are subject to tax when the transient accommodations are provided to the guest or tenant.\n(d)1. Deposits or prepayments applied to rental charges or room rates are deemed to include the applicable taxes when a guest or tenant has been put on notice that the amount of any deposit or prepayment includes any applicable taxes. See subsection (20) of this rule.\n2. Example: A potential guest reserves a hotel room for a designated night by issuing a credit card authorization for the amount of the room rate, plus applicable taxes, to the hotel. The guest does not arrive at the hotel to occupy the room, but fails to cancel the reservation. The hotel charges the guest\u2019s credit card for the room, plus applicable taxes. The hotel is required to remit the applicable taxes to the proper taxing authority.\n(e)1. \u201cReservation voucher\u201d means a voucher which entitles the purchaser to rent transient accommodations that are reserved by the seller for the purchaser at a designated location for a specified rental period and at a specified room rate or rental charge.

The voucher is required to be presented to the owner or owner\u2019s representative of the transient accommodations. When the voucher is presented to the owner or owner\u2019s representative, the amount of the reservation deposit, prepayment, or fee paid to the seller of the voucher is a part of the room rate or rental charge paid for the right to use the accommodation. The owner or owner\u2019s representative of the transient accommodation is required to collect and remit the applicable taxes due to the proper taxing authority on the total room rate or rental charge, including any amounts separately stated on the redeemed voucher as a reservation deposit, prepayment, or fee.\n2. The owner or owner\u2019s representative may execute a written agreement to designate the seller of the reservation voucher as the party responsible to collect and remit the applicable transient rental taxes on the portion of the room rate or rental charge for the transient accommodation collected by the seller of the voucher. Sellers of reservation vouchers who have entered into such agreements with owners or owners\u2019 representatives of transient accommodations are required to collect and remit the applicable taxes due to the proper taxing authority on the portion of the room rate or rental charge collected by such seller. The applicable taxes are to be collected at the rates imposed by the county where the transient accommodation is located. The amount of the rental charge or room rate collected by the seller of the voucher must be indicated, and the tax must be separately stated, on the reservation voucher.\n(7) Recreational resort membership agreements.\n(a) The sale of memberships in this State for the right to be a member of a recreational resort providing transient accommodations and other recreational facilities in this State is a taxable lease of transient accommodations.\n(b) Rental charges made pursuant to an agreement by which the owner or the owner\u2019s representative offers for lease the right to reserve and occupy either a general or specific type of unit or transient accommodation, usually for 1 or 2 weeks during a year for a specific number of years, are subject to tax. Tax is due on the rental charges when the charges are due, whether the charges are paid in full at the time of agreement or financed over a period of time. When the rental charges are financed over a period of time as an installment sale or deferred payment plan, tax is due when the agreement is executed. All charges required to be paid by the lessee to the owner, lessor, or the lessor\u2019s represenative under the terms of the agreement, such as maintenance fees, membership dues, or similar charges, are subject to tax at the time payment is due.\n(c)1. A typical membership agreement grants the member the right to use certain resort facilities located in Florida and the right to use certain resort facilities located outside Florida for a nominal amount or free of any charge. The agreement provides that the member has the right to stay at a resort facility for a limited number of consecutive days (usually 7 to 30 days) within any year for a designated number of years during the life of the membership. The agreement further provides that the membership fee is to be paid in full at the time of entering into the agreement, or that a partial payment be made with the remaining amount to be financed over a period of time. In addition to the initial membership fee, the agreement requires that periodic payments of maintenance fees, dues, or similar charges be made to use the facilities and to retain membership in the resort.\n2.

The tax is to be collected by the person selling the membership on the total initial membership fee at the time the membership agreement is entered into, whether the membership is paid in full or financed over a period of time. Tax is due on all charges for maintenance fees, membership dues, or similar charges when such charges are billed to the member.\n3. Membership agreements entered into with resort facilities located outside this State that also allow a member to use resort facilities located in Florida for a nominal charge or free of charge are not subject to tax, unless the out-of-state seller of the membership allocates or distributes a portion of the proceeds to the Florida resort. Any proceeds allocated or distributed to the Florida resort are taxable. In addition, any charge made by the owner or lessor of a Florida resort to an out-of-state membership holder for the right to use its Florida resort is subject to tax.\n(d) Agreements that convey a fee interest in real property are not membership agreements as contemplated by this subsection and are not subject to sales tax.\n(8) Timeshares.\n(a) Purchase of a timeshare interest.\n1. Consideration paid for the purchase of a timeshare estate, as defined in Section 721.05, F.S., is not rent and is not subject to tax.\n2. Consideration paid for the purchase of a timeshare license, as defined in Section 721.05, F.S., is rent and is subject to tax.\n(b) Rental of a timeshare accommodation. Consideration paid for the use or occupancy of an accommodation in a timeshare property is rent and is subject to tax. Consideration paid for a regulated short-term product or a timeshare exchange is addressed below.\n(c) Regulated short-term products. Consideration paid for occupancy pursuant to a regulated short-term product, as defined in Section 721.05, F.S., is rent and is subject to tax, unless the consideration paid is applied to the purchase of a timeshare estate. Tax is due on the last day of occupancy pursuant to the regulated short-term product.\n(d) Timeshare exchange programs.\n1. A typical timeshare exchange program allows timeshare owners the right to deposit their timeshares into the exchange program pool. After depositing his or her timeshare into the exchange program pool, an owner may request the use of a different timeshare. An owner making a request will specify the type of unit desired (e.g., one-bedroom, oceanfront) and the location at which he or she would like to stay (e.g., Honolulu, Cancun, Miami), but will generally not request the use of a specific timeshare unit. A timeshare owner who joins an exchange program pays a membership fee to be a part of the exchange program. An owner also pays an exchange fee to request an exchange of a timeshare under the program. The requesting owner may also pay an upgrade fee if the exchange program determines that the requesting owner\u2019s timeshare is of a lesser value than the timeshare being requested.\n2.a. Consideration paid for the use or occupancy of an accommodation in a timeshare property by a timeshare owner to an exchange program is not subject to tax.\nb. Example: Mr. Smith purchases a two-bedroom timeshare in Orlando and becomes a member of an exchange program. Mr. Smith pays an annual membership fee of $500 to be a member of the exchange program, which must be paid whether or not Mr. Smith requests the use of another timeshare from the exchange program pool.

Agents, representatives, or management companies that collect and receive rent as the owner\u2019s representative are required to register as a dealer and collect and remit the applicable tax due on such rentals to the proper taxing authority. If the agent, representative, or management company has no role in collecting or receiving the rental charges or room rates, the person receiving such rent is required to register as a dealer and collect and remit the applicable tax due on such rentals to the proper taxing authority.\n(b)1. Transient accommodations, including timeshare units, that are rented, leased, let, or for which a license to use has been granted to others for periods six months or less may be collectively registered by an agent, representative, or management company under the provisions of subsection (3) of Rule 12A-1.060, F.A.C.\n2. Even though a written agreement exists between the agent, representative, or management company and the property owner, the property owner remains responsible for the tax obligation in the event the agent, representative, or management company fails to collect or remit the tax due to the proper taxing authority and the taxing authority is unable to collect the applicable tax from the agent, representative, or management company.\n3. The following is a suggested format of the written agreement executed after July 1, 1994, between an agent, representative, or management company and the owner of any transient accommodations that are offered for rent, lease, let, or for which a license to use is granted to others for periods of six months or less:\nI, _____ (Name of Property or Timeshare Period Owner), hereby authorize _____ (Name of Agent, Representative, or Management Company) to act as my representative to rent, lease, let, or grant a license to others to use my described property (properties) or timeshare period (timeshare periods) located at _____ (use additional paper if necessary) and to charge, collect, and remit sales tax levied under Chapter 212, F.S., to the Department of Revenue. I acknowledge that, by renting, leasing, letting, or offering a license to others to use any transient accommodations, as defined in subsection (3) of Rule 12A-1.061, F.A.C., I am exercising a taxable privilege under Chapter 212, F.S., and as such acknowledge that I am ultimately liable for any sales tax due the State of Florida on such rentals, leases, lets, or licenses to use. I fully understand that should the State be unable to collect any taxes, penalties, and interest due from the rental, lease, let, or license to use my property, a warrant for such uncollected amount will be issued and will become a lien against my property until satisfied.\n______________________________\n(Signature of Property Owner/Lessor)\n___________________________________________________\n(Signature of Agent, Representative, or Management Company).\n4. The agent, representative, or management company and the property owner must maintain a copy of the written agreement in their records until the tax imposed by Chapter 212, F.S., may no longer be determined and assessed under Section 95.091(3), F.S. Upon request, a copy of the agreement must be made available to the Department.\n5. The agent, representative, or management company must notify the Department of Revenue when it receives affirmative, written notice that it ceases to manage any transient accommodation for which it has collectively registered under the provisions of subsection (3), of Rule 12A-1.060, F.A.C.

This form is not required to be filed with the Department when the owner or owner\u2019s representative of an exempt camp or park determines at the time of annual review that the rental charges for transient accommodations continue to qualify for exemption.\n4. Mobile home lots regulated under Chapter 723, F.S., are exempt from tax on the lot rental amount. Owners and owners\u2019 representatives of mobile home lots regulated under Chapter 723, F.S., are not required to file Form DR-72-2 with the Department to declare the mobile home lot exempt or required to make an annual redetermination of the taxable status of the lot.\n5.

To qualify for this exemption, the person or entity must pay the applicable tax due on the rental charges or room rates for the first six months of the continuous rental period and must rent the accommodations for periods longer than six continuous months.\nb. Example: Company A provides hotel rooms to house its employees at a hotel. Because the number of employees needing a room varies each night, the number of rooms rented by Company A varies each night. However, Company A rents and pays the applicable tax due on at least 10 hotel rooms each night for a consecutive six month period. Beginning the seventh month of the continuous rental period, Company A is exempt from tax due on the rental charges or room rates for 10 rooms at that hotel as long as it pays the room rates for at least 10 rooms at that hotel. Any rental charges or room rates for additional rooms paid by Company A are subject to tax, until the rental charges or room rates for those rooms qualify for exemption.\n2.a. Any person who enters into a bona fide written lease, as provided in subsection (17), to lease a specified number of transient accommodations at a multiple unit structure each night during the lease period for its own use, is exempt from tax due on the rental charges or room rates applicable to the specified minimum number of accommodations.

To be considered a lease for periods longer than six months, a bona fide written lease agreement effective the first day of a month must run through the first day of the seventh consecutive month. For example, a lease agreement that is effective July 1, 1997 through January 1, 1998, will qualify as a lease for periods longer than six months.\n3. To be considered a lease for periods longer than six months, a bona fide written lease agreement effective at some other date than the first day of a month must be in effect through the day after the corresponding day of the seventh consecutive month. For example, a lease agreement that is effective July 28, 1997 through January 29, 1998, will qualify as a lease for periods longer than six months.\n(c) For the purposes of this subsection, a \u201cbona fide written lease\u201d is a written document that clearly demonstrates that the parties\u2019 intent is that the lessee will have the exclusive use or possession, or the right to the exclusive use or possession, of the transient accommodations to which the lease applies.\n(d) The written lease must contain:\n1.

A lease does not cease to be a bona fide written lease if the lessor is in violation of a fire or safety code such that the lessee is forced to move to another location.\n4. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201csignificant change in circumstances\u201d means the occurrence of an event, not contemplated at the time of the signing of the lease, such as an illness, death, bankruptcy, significant change in business circumstances (e.g., long-term strike or the ceasing of doing business in the locality), loss of job, or job transfer, that would cause the lessor or lessee to suffer a hardship if the lessor or lessee were forced to honor the lease until its stated termination date.\n(g) A \u201cbona fide written lease\u201d for periods longer than six months for continuous residence by the individual or entity leasing the transient accommodations to which the written lease applies will not be constituted when:\n1.

The lease contains a provision that would entitle the lessor of the leased transient accommodations to sublease, subrent, sublet, or license the accommodations to other persons for periods of six months or less;\n3. The lease does not provide the lessee with the right to occupy the transient accommodations for the entire duration of the lease period;\n4. The lease contains a provision that allows the lessee to cancel the lease, without penalty, at any time when the lessee has had no significant changes in circumstances; or\n5. The lease contains a provision that would allow the lessee to avoid full payment of the stated amount of the rental charge or room rate.\n(h)1. The Department will presume that the parties to the lease did not in fact intend to enter into a bona fide written lease for a period of more than six months for continuous residence when:\na. The leased transient accommodations are leased more than two times in a calendar year with each lease issued during that calendar year containing statements indicating that the lease period is for longer than six months; and,\nb. No lessee leased the transient accommodations for more than six months.\n2. This presumption can be rebutted by documentary evidence (i.e., notarized statements, eviction documents, etc.) that provides, for each lease terminated prior to its stated termination date, that:\na.

Each January, a hotel must determine the percentage to be applied to reimbursements received during the subsequent calendar year using the following calculation:\nTotal Reimbursements Received in Prior Calendar Year \u2012 Total Contributions Paid in Prior Calendar Year\n\u00f7 Total Reimbursements Received in Prior Calendar Year\n= Percentage to be Applied to Reimbursements Received in Current Calendar Year\nIf the resulting percentage is zero or less, then no transient rental tax is due on reimbursements received in the current calendar year.\n2. The full amount of reimbursements received by the hotel in the current reporting period must be multiplied by the percentage to determine the amount of reimbursements subject to transient rental tax for that reporting period.\n3. Example: A hotel\u2019s total reimbursements and contributions in the preceding calendar year are $10,000 and $7,500, respectively. The hotel\u2019s percentage for the current calendar year will be calculated in January as ($10,000 - $7,500)/$10,000 or 25%. If the current reporting period\u2019s reimbursements are $1,000, the amount of reimbursements subject to tax in the current reporting period is $250.\n(d) Calculation of Taxable Reimbursements for a Hotel\u2019s Initial Twelve Months of Participation in a Reward Points Program.\n1. At the end of a hotel\u2019s initial twelve months of participation in a reward points program, the hotel must determine the percentage to be applied to reimbursements received during the initial twelve months of participation using the following calculation:\nTotal Reimbursements Received During the Initial Twelve Months \u2012 Total Annual Contributions Paid During the Initial Twelve Months\n\u00f7 Total Reimbursements Received During the Initial Twelve Months\n= Percentage to be Applied to Reimbursements Received in the Initial Twelve Months\nIf the resulting percentage is zero or less, then no transient rental tax is due on reimbursements received in the initial twelve months of participation.\n2. The full amount of reimbursements received by the hotel in the initial twelve months of participation must be multiplied by the percentage to determine the amount of reimbursements subject to transient rental tax for the initial twelve months. The full amount of any tax due must be remitted with the hotel\u2019s first tax return due following the end of the initial twelve months of participation. The hotel must keep a supplemental schedule allocating the remittance to the appropriate reporting periods of the initial twelve months of participation in the hotel\u2019s books and records kept in the normal course of business. This schedule must be made available to the proper taxing authority upon request.\n3. The percentage calculated for the initial twelve months of participation must also be used to calculate taxable reimbursements for all remaining reporting periods in the calendar year in which the calculation is made.\n4. Example: A hotel begins participating in a reward points program in June 2010. In June 2011, the hotel must calculate the percentage using the total reimbursement and contribution amounts for June 2010 through May 2011. The resulting percentage must be applied to all reimbursements received from June 1, 2010, through May 31, 2011, to determine the amount of reimbursements subject to transient rental tax for that period.

This rule is intended to provide guidelines for the partial exemption for vessels and vessel parts provided in Section 212.08(8), F.S., to persons who transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or who operate commercial fishing vessels.\n(2) Vessels.\n(a) Vessels that are used to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce and commercial fishing vessels are subject to the partial exemption provided in Section 212.08(8), F.S. Tax imposed is based on the ratio of Florida mileage to total mileage traveled by the carrier\u2019s vessels that were used in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes and that had at least some Florida mileage during the previous fiscal year of the carrier.\n(b) The mileage of vessels from the territorial limit to port dockside and return into international waters, foreign or coastwise, in the continuous movement of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce is not considered to be mileage in Florida.\n(c) \u201cCommercial fishing vessels\u201d include vessels designed, constructed, and used exclusively for the taking of fish, crayfish, oysters, shrimp, and sponges from the salt and fresh waters for sale. Vessels used for sports or pleasure fishing, such as pleasure fishing boats, charter boats, or party boats, are not commercial fishing vessels.\n(d) Vessels used in intrastate commerce exclusively within the territorial waters of Florida do not qualify for the partial exemption.\n(e) Vessels that are not operated to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce, even though such vessels may move persons or property across the Florida state line, do not qualify for the partial exemption. For example, a dredge is operated by a company to transport its workmen and equipment between two states. The dredge is not operated to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce, because the company is not receiving compensation for transporting its own workmen. The purchase of the dredge does not qualify for the partial exemption.\n(f) Vessels that are not engaged in transporting persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes are subject to tax, as provided in Section 212.05, F.S.\n(3) Computation of mileage apportionment factor and tax due.\n(a) Vessel owners are required, at the end of each fiscal year of operation, to determine the ratio of Florida mileage to total mileage traveled by the owner\u2019s vessels operated to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes that had at least some Florida mileage during the fiscal year. The ratio computed is the owner\u2019s mileage apportionment factor to be applied to purchases, leases, and rentals of vessels, and parts thereof, subject to the partial exemption under Section 212.08(8), F.S., during the following fiscal year.\n(b) Vessel owners are required to apply their mileage apportionment factor calculated at the end of the prior fiscal year to purchases and leases of vessels, and parts thereof, that will be operated exclusively to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or", "start_char_idx": 1481200, "end_char_idx": 1484868, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab08030e-b674-4719-9233-669029eafec1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab08030e-b674-4719-9233-669029eafec1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c53751f-56d3-48aa-8f23-c6e93c3ff580", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "49cefce46c794086085a41a7aa4a7a745c29dbbfc9f092166cb41a7b4ff3f940"}, "3": {"node_id": "21637766-0488-419a-9c19-dcb99c2a1b20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fbb5cde9313c502e2f5ca5e5346a8762da5d65ad4b20dd86a97cb974b2dbc6b9"}}, "hash": "48b70be09f461466e3cc34979a45e4528fbbfbad07a1a5fed9812e43d6051baa", "text": "that will be operated exclusively to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes during the current fiscal year. Vessel owners are required to calculate and report tax to the Department on a monthly basis.\n(c) During the owner\u2019s initial year of operation in Florida, the owner\u2019s mileage apportionment factor may be determined on the basis of the ratio of anticipated Florida mileage to anticipated total mileage for that year for the owner\u2019s vessels used to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes that are anticipated to have at least some Florida mileage. At the end of the initial year of operation, the owner is required to determine the mileage apportionment factor based on the actual Florida mileage and the actual total mileage for the initial year of operation. The owner is required to pay any additional tax due based on the actual mileage ratio. The tax is due with the owner\u2019s return due for the first month of the owner\u2019s second year of operation in this state. The owner may take a credit or apply to the Department for a refund of tax paid, as provided in Rule 12A-1.014, F.A.C., when the tax paid based on the estimated mileage ratio exceeds the tax due based on the actual mileage ratio for the initial year of operation.\n(4) Claiming the exemption at the time of purchase of a vessel.\n(a) To claim the exemption at the time of purchase of a vessel that will be used exclusively in non-Florida waters to transport persons or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce or for commercial fishing purposes, the vessel owner, or the owner\u2019s agent or representative purchasing the vessel, is required to issue an affidavit to the selling dealer.

A public street or road which is used for transportation purposes.\na. Tolls imposed exclusively for the right to travel on turnpikes, expressways, bridges, and other public roadway are payments for the use of the public roadway and are thus exempt. Example: The toll charged by a city to the general public for the right to cross a bridge is a payment for transportation purposes; therefore, it is exempt.\nb. However, a charge for the right to use a public or private roadway for non-transportation purposes is fully taxable. Example: A civic organization that is not exempt from sales tax contracts with a city to have certain streets and sidewalks blocked from traffic to conduct its annual festival. The privilege granted by the city to the civic organization for the use of the streets and sidewalks constitutes a license to use real property for non-transportation purposes. Therefore, any charge by the city to the civic organization for the use of streets and sidewalks is taxable.\n6.a.

The lease or license to use passenger loading bridges (jetways) and baggage conveyor systems comes under this exemption, provided that the jetways and baggage conveyor systems are deemed real property.\n(I) In order for the jetways and baggage conveyors to be deemed real property, the owner of these items must also be the owner of the land to which they are attached, and must have had the intention that such property become a permanent accession to the realty from the moment of installation. The items shall not be considered real property if the owner, when the owner is not the airport, retains title to the items after the purchase/installation indebtedness has been paid in full.\n(II) Any operator of an airport, such as an airport authority, which is the lessee of the land on which the airport has its situs is, for the purpose of this sub-subparagraph, deemed the owner of such land.\nc. Real property used by an airline for purposes of loading or unloading passengers or property onto or from an aircraft which is exempt from tax includes: office areas used to process tickets, baggage processing areas, operations areas used for the purpose of the operational control of an airline\u2019s aircraft, and air cargo areas.\n(I) If any portion of the above property is used for any other purpose, it is taxed on a pro-rata basis, which shall be determined by the square footage of the portion of the areas in the airport that are used by an airline exclusively for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers or property onto or from aircraft (which areas shall be the numerator) compared to the total square footage of such areas used by the airline (which areas shall be the denominator).\n(II) Example: An airline leases a total of 3,000 square feet from an airport authority. The airline uses the space as follows: 1,000 square feet are used to process tickets and check in the passengers\u2019 luggage; 1,000 square feet are used for the passengers\u2019 departure lounge; and 1,000 square feet are used for the management office and the employees\u2019 lounge. The 1,000 square feet used to process tickets and check in the passengers\u2019 luggage is exempt; the 1,000 square feet used as the passengers\u2019 departure lounge is also exempt; and the 1,000 square feet used as the management office and employees\u2019 lounge is taxable. Therefore, a total of 2,000 square feet is exempt because that portion of the total space leased by the airline is used exclusively for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or property onto or from an aircraft. However, the total amount used as office space and the employees\u2019 lounge (i.e., 1,000 square feet) is taxable, because that portion of the space leased by the airline is not used exclusively for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or property onto or from an aircraft.\nd. Real property used for fueling aircraft is taxable when the fueling activities are conducted by a lessee or licensee which is not an airline. However, the charge made to an airline for the use of aprons, ramps or other areas used for fueling aircraft is exempt.\n7.a. Property used at a port authority exclusively for the purpose of oceangoing vessels or tugs docking, or such vessels mooring on property used by a port authority for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers or cargo onto or from such vessels, or property used at a port authority for fueling such vessels.

Example: Landlord owns a building with 5 offices and common areas. All offices are the same size. Landlord uses one office and leases the other four. The lease agreement provides that the utility charges are \u201cadditional rent\u201d and failure to pay such utility charges when required will cause the lease to terminate. All offices use approximately the same amount of utilities. Utility services are sold by City Utilities to Landlord. Landlord\u2019s total utility bill is $1,900. Of that total, $150 was non-taxable water, garbage, and sewage charges.\nLandlord charges each tenant $2,000 rent and 1/5 of Landlord\u2019s total utility bill with no mark-up. Tenant owes tax on the rent and on his portion of the utility charges not taxed to Landlord. Therefore, the invoice to the tenant for the month should read: \nRent \t$2,000.00\nTenant\u2019s one-fifth share of charges not taxed to Landlord ($150 * 20%)\t30.00\nTotal subject to sales tax \t$2,030.00\nFlorida (5.5%) sales tax \t111.65\nReimbursement for one-fifth share of utilities on which tax was paid by Landlord ($1,900 - $150 * 20%)\t350.00\nTotal Amount Due \t$2,491.65\n2. Example: Same facts as above, except Landlord marks up Tenants\u2019 share of the total of City Utilities\u2019 service bill by 10 percent. Thus each tenant\u2019s one-fifth share of utilities would be $418.00, instead of $380.00. Again, if Landlord separately states the utility charges on the tenant\u2019s invoice, Landlord should compute the tax as follows:\nRent \t$2,000.00\nTenant\u2019s one-fifth share of utilities not taxed (total utilities $418.00, less utilities on which Landlord paid tax, 350.00)\t68.00\nTotal subject to tax \t$2,068.00\nFlorida (5.5%) sales tax \t113.74\nReimbursement for one-fifth share of utilities on which tax was paid by Landlord\t350.00\nTotal Amount Due \t$2,531.74\n(f) The tax shall be due and payable at the time of the receipt of the rental or license fee payment by the lessor or other person who receives the rental or payment. The owner, lessor, or person receiving the rent or license fee shall remit the tax to the Department at the times and in the manner provided in Rule 12A-1.056, F.A.C.\n(g)1. The amount charged by a lessor to a lessee to cancel or terminate a lease agreement is subject to tax if the lessor records such charge as rental income in its books and records. If such charge is not recorded as rental income by the lessor, then such charge is not considered a payment for the lease of the real property but as a payment to cancel or terminate the lease agreement.\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 1., above, if the amount paid by a lessee to a lessor to cancel or terminate a lease agreement is recorded as a rental expense in the lessee\u2019s books and records, then such payment is subject to tax. However, if the lessee does not record that payment as a rental expense, then such payment is not considered a payment for the lease of the real property but as a payment to cancel or terminate the agreement, and is not subject to tax. If the lessee records the payment as a rental expense but does not remit tax to the lessor on such payment, then the lessee is required to remit the tax on such charge directly to the Department of Revenue. The lessee is required to remit the tax on Form DR-15, Sales and Use Tax Return, if a registered dealer, or if unregistered, the lessee is required to remit the tax on Form DR-15MO, Out-of-State Purchase Return.

Proration shall be computed on square footage or some other basis acceptable to the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee in the responsible program. For example, Tenant leases 200 square feet of floor space for $400.00 and pays Landlord $22.00 rental tax. Tenant subleases 100 square feet, or one half, of the space to Subtenant for $300.00 and collects $16.50 tax which he remits to the State, less a credit of $11.00 for tax that he paid to his landlord on the space that he subleased to Subtenant. (One half of $400.00 is $200.00 and 5.5 percent of this amount is $11.00.)\n(9) If a tenant or other person sublets or assigns his interest in all of the leased or licensed premises, or retains only an incidental portion of the entire premises, then such tenant or other person may elect not to pay tax on the prime lease or license, provided that such tenant or other person shall register as a dealer and collect and remit tax due on the sub-rentals or assignments and pay the tax due on the portion of the rental charges or license fees pertaining to any taxable space which he retains.

It is not essential for a transfer of possession of tangible personal property to include the right to move the tangible personal property. It includes a transaction under which a person secures for a consideration the temporary use of tangible personal property which, although not on his premises, is operated by or under the direction or control of the person or his employees. All leases of tangible personal property other than conditional-sale type leases as described in paragraph (1)(d) of this rule, are operating leases.

Custody or possession of the property, actual or constructive;\n2. The right to custody or possession of the property; or\n3. The right to use and control or direct the use of the property.\n(c) For an operating lease, tax applies to the gross proceeds derived from the lease of tangible personal property for the entire term of the lease when the lessor of such property is an established business, part of an established business, or leasing tangible personal property is incidental or germane to the lessor\u2019s business.\n1. The \u201cgross proceeds derived\u201d means the total consideration agreed by the parties for the lease of the tangible personal property. Sales tax is due and payable by the lessee to the lessor when the lessee\u2019s obligation arises to pay to the lessor each agreed payment, irrespective of whether the lessee has complied with the obligation to pay the agreed payment(s) to the lessor.\n2. Gross proceeds for purposes of this rule include, in addition to the amount attributable to the rental of tangible personal property:\na. Any interest charges whether or not separately stated, unless the interest charges are clearly imposed for late payment or other defaults under the lease.\nb. Ad valorem taxes due by the lessee or other person actually using, or entitled to use the tangible personal property to the lessor or any other person on behalf of the lessor, including transactions between affiliated entities.\nc. Any portion of an insurance premium due by the lessee or other person actually using, or entitled to use the tangible personal property to the lessor or any other person on behalf of the lessor which names the lessor or his assigns as the beneficiary thereof and which is separately stated or itemized. However, when a lessee or other person pays insurance for his own protection, the premium is not regarded as gross proceeds subject to tax, even though the lessor or other person granting the right to use the tangible personal property is also protected by the coverage.\nd. Freight charges incurred as part of the lease transaction. See Rule 12A-1.045, F.A.C.\n(d) Where a contract designated as a lease transfers substantially all the benefits, including depreciation, and risks inherent in the ownership of tangible personal property to the lessee, and ownership of the property transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or the contract contains a purchase option for a nominal amount, the contract shall be regarded as a sale of tangible personal property under a security agreement commonly referred to as a conditional-sale type lease, from its inception. The purchase option shall be regarded as a nominal amount if it does not exceed $100 or 1 percent of the total contract price, whichever is the lesser amount.\n(e) Whether a lease is a conditional-sale type lease or an operating lease shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, read in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was executed. Taxpayers who calculated and paid taxes on leases, entered into after January 2, 1989, pursuant to any amendments to paragraph (1)(d) of this rule adopted after January 2, 1989, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this rule.\n(f) In the case of a conditional-sale type lease executed on or after the effective date of this rule, the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee in the responsible program will consider these to be sales and purchases from their inception with tax due and payable at the moment the contractual agreement is entered into or when the property comes to rest in this state if at a later date. Charges for interest or financing are taxable unless the rate of interest or the actual amount of interest charged is separately stated on the customer\u2019s contract.\n(2)(a) Tangible personal property purchased exclusively for leasing purposes by a dealer registered with the Department at the time", "start_char_idx": 1557976, "end_char_idx": 1562213, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2400ac7-4a86-4576-92ee-a68647f54e71": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2400ac7-4a86-4576-92ee-a68647f54e71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "460233e0-20ea-4132-a612-bdfa1c9ac3f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "99d3e528ddbdfcc210e2b26d94ad509b5d1289f660eb00b4bca3486f84239072"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c1fb16b-a12f-48a0-b440-b181bd9b5d91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b11535f1710ddbcfc8ccab2e43974220c2a0332220fd3f820cc585e48285ce3b"}}, "hash": "d5f992649d30d93139a58a8d2d9f851cc7989d0ae179fba2aaadfea6ffa4eeab", "text": "purchased exclusively for leasing purposes by a dealer registered with the Department at the time of purchase may be purchased tax-exempt.

Any person who purchases tangible personal property for the dual purpose of leasing it to others and also for his own use, or who purchases tangible personal property with the intention only of leasing it but in fact also uses the property itself, shall pay the tax on the cost price of such property and shall also collect and remit the tax on all leases of such property.\n2. The subsequent conversion to one\u2019s own use, of tangible personal property which has been purchased tax exempt for exclusive lease, will be subject to use tax at the time of conversion. The basis of the use tax will be \u201cfair market value\u201d at the time of conversion. If the fair market value of the tangible personal property cannot be determined, then the use tax due at the time of conversion should be based on the acquisition cost of the tangible personal property. Under no circumstances will the aggregate amount of sales tax, from leasing and the use tax at the time of conversion, be less than the total sales tax that would have been due on the original acquisition cost paid by the lessor.\n(3) An out-of-state owner or lessor of equipment is doing business in Florida when his tangible personal property is located in Florida in the possession of a lessee, and the owner or lessor shall register and comply with the provision of Chapter 212, F.S. The lease of tangible personal property which is used or stored in this state shall be taxable without regard to its prior use or tax paid on purchase outside this state.\n(4) If the lessee of tangible personal property removes the property from the State of Florida, the consideration contracted to be paid subsequent to such removal is not taxable, provided the lessee furnishes the lessor with a signed certificate identifying the property, and the date the property was or will be removed from this state. If the lessee has obtained self-accrual authority from the Department of Revenue, as provided in Rule 12A-1.0911, F.A.C., then the lessee\u2019s records must substantiate when the property was removed from this state. Rental amounts charged or paid while the property is in Florida are taxable, even though the property is moved from the state immediately after the lessee takes possession of it. This does not apply to motor vehicles. See Rule 12A-1.007, F.A.C., for application of tax to rental of motor vehicles.\n(5)(a) Rental receipts from motion picture films, when an admission is charged for viewing such films, are exempt.\n(b) Tax applies to leases of video cassettes, videotapes, and videodiscs for private use when the lessee does not obtain or acquire the right to license, broadcast, exhibit, or reproduce the video cassettes, videotapes, or videodiscs.\n(c) Film and license fees and direct charges for films, videotapes, transcriptions, program syndication, and network syndication used by television stations, radio stations, or networks are exempt.\n(6) The lease payments on tangible personal property which is leased solely for the purpose of leasing it to a third party are exempt. The prime lessee is required to register with the Department as a dealer and issue the prime lessor a resale certificate in lieu of tax.\n(7) Each operating lease payment due under a lease purchase or similar agreement which also grants the lessee an option to purchase the tangible personal property is taxable. When the option is exercised and title to the property passes to the lessee-purchaser, no tax is due on that part of the purchase price upon which lease tax has been paid.

See subsection 12A-1.037(6), F.A.C., for occasional rental of tangible personal property.\n(12) The charges under contracts between separate legal entities, such as two corporations, or between a corporation and an individual or between a corporation and a partnership covering the lease of tangible personal property are taxable, even though the stock of the corporation is owned by the same stockholders or by the other contracting parties. Charges under a lease between a partnership and one or more of the individual partners are taxable.\n(13) A corporation must charge tax on the gross proceeds derived, from leases of equipment to an individual or to individuals owning 100 percent of its stock.\n(14)(a) Tax is due and payable on the charge by a dealer to a customer for the retention of tangible personal property beyond a stipulated time. Such \u201ccharges\u201d shall constitute part of the total consideration for the continued possession of tangible personal property when the lessor records such charges as rental income in its books and records. However, if such charges are specifically designated and itemized in the contract, charge ticket, sales slip, invoice, or other tangible evidence of the lease as a penalty or late fee, then such charges or fees are only incidental to the sale, and do not constitute part of the sales price; therefore, such charges are not subject to tax.\n(b)1. The amount charged by a lessor to a lessee to cancel or terminate a lease agreement is subject to tax if the lessor records such charge as rental income in its books and records. If such charge is not recorded as rental income by the lessor, then such charge is not considered a payment for the lease of the tangible personal property but as a payment to cancel or terminate the lease agreement.\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (b)1. above, if the amount paid by a lessee to a lessor to cancel or terminate a lease agreement is recorded as a rental expense in the lessee\u2019s books and records, then such payment is subject to tax. However, if the lessee does not record that payment as a rental expense, then such payment is not considered a payment for the lease of the tangible personal property but as a payment to cancel or terminate the agreement, and is not subject to tax.

Should the lessee record the payment as a rental expense but provide documentation, such as a lease or other tangible evidence, to establish that the payment is for other than the use of tangible personal property, then such payment is not subject to tax.\n4. Should the lessor or lessee record the payment as other than rental income or rental expense, but documentation exists, such as a lease or other tangible evidence, to establish that the payment was additional payment for the use of tangible personal property, then such payment is subject to tax.\n(15) When a boat or vessel is chartered with crew furnished, for the carriage or transportation of persons or property from one point to another and the charterer does not have any direction or control over its operation, the contract constitutes a service transaction and not the rental of tangible personal property and is exempt. See paragraph (17)(c) for charter fishing vessels.\n(16) When a boat or vessel is leased or rented on a \u201cbare boat\u201d basis, the sales tax applies to the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental. The lease or rental is considered to be on a \u201cbare boat\u201d basis when:\n(a) The lessor does not provide a crew;\n(b) The lessor does provide a crew but it is hired by the lessee under a separate employment contract. (Under such circumstances the employment contract cost is not a part of the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental and is not taxable.)\n(17)(a) When the owner of a boat or vessel operated as a \u201chead-boat\u201d or \u201cparty boat\u201d supplies the crew, which remains under the control and direction of the owner, and makes a charge measured on an admission or entrance or length of stay aboard the vessel for the privilege of participating in sightseeing, dinner cruises, sport, recreation, or similar activities including fishing, the charge is taxable as an admission.\n(b) Example: A vessel having a capacity for 6 persons operates as a \u201cparty\u201d or \u201chead-boat\u201d with a charge of $50 per person for a day fishing trip whether 1 or 6 persons are carried on the trip. The charge made is considered a charge for admission and is subject to sales tax.\n(c) The charge made for chartering any boat or vessel with a crew furnished, solely for the purpose of fishing, is exempt from the tax on admissions and from the tax on leases or rentals of tangible personal property.\n(d) Example: A vessel similar to that in the example in paragraph (b) above is available for a day fishing trip for a charge of $300 per day, with crew furnished, without any reduction for the number of persons participating in the trip. This transaction qualifies as a charter fishing trip and the charge is not subject to sales tax.\n(18) Unless a boat or vessel is purchased exclusively for rental on a bare boat basis as described in subsection (16), the purchase of the boat or vessel and parts thereof is taxable. See Rule 12A-1.0641, F.A.C., for vessels engaged in interstate and foreign commerce.\n(19) The rental charges on water recreation or transportation devices, including but not limited to boats, sailboats, sailboards, surfboards, pedal boats, skis, jet skis, and canoes are taxable as rentals of tangible personal property.\n(20) The rental of aircraft is taxable.\n(21) The charge made by an air taxi (charter) to transport a passenger to a certain destination (the passenger does not pilot or take possession of the aircraft) is a charge for transportation service rather than a rental and is exempt from", "start_char_idx": 1570473, "end_char_idx": 1574385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ceb3bde-f8db-43d4-aa7a-c9f9cd2a6ef6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ceb3bde-f8db-43d4-aa7a-c9f9cd2a6ef6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3a9ac10-4bc6-4d32-a971-0e8b151aa13f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "274472c7461263d12a83aaabbe07eb8877885f4f3f5c97df47ba174ee587a260"}, "3": {"node_id": "350bfcb4-21eb-4aff-a9b6-20ff1d6391e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1de819365949e0dcde1e4d7652351aee0fdd62cf3708ecf57bc463946a410fb4"}}, "hash": "67267066d719a0ed202a4c88d88a6958f5d4e23668cd95f65ad6fdfa8dc4211d", "text": "the aircraft) is a charge for transportation service rather than a rental and is exempt from tax.\n(22) A charge for flight instruction, which includes supervised solo flights, is exempt.

Such equipment, when furnished to meat markets at no charge, is taxable to the dealer at the time of acquisition.\n(33) Caterers are required to pay tax on the purchases or rentals of all dishes, tables, chairs, silver, linens, kitchen utensils, artificial palms, and other items used by them in the conduct of their business. The caterer should pay tax to his supplier and should not furnish the supplier with a resale certificate, except in those instances where he is purchasing or renting such items exclusively for rental and for which he makes a separate charge to his customer.\n(34) The rental or lease of a United States flag or the official flag of Florida is exempt. The rental or lease as a unit of a kit that includes the United States flag or the official flag of Florida and related accessories, such as a mounting bracket, a standard, a halyard, and instructions for the display of the flag is also exempt.

When an \u201coperating lease\u201d is assigned, whether or not title to the leased or rented property is transferred, the rental or lease payments are subject to tax. If title is transferred, tax applies based on the sales price. The situations described below involve assignments of existing \u201coperating leases\u201d subject to tax measured by rental payments:\n(b) Assignment of a right and creation of a security interest. This type of assignment is an assignment by the lessor of the right to receive the lease payments together with the creation of a security interest in the leased property which is designated as such. The assignee has recourse against the assignor. The assignee does not have the rights of a lessor and is not obligated to collect or remit tax on the rental payments. The lessor is subject to the obligation of collecting and remitting the tax even though the lessor does not receive the rental payments directly from the lessee. The assignee, however, is required to remit any amounts paid to him by the lessee as tax. If the assignee enforces the security agreement and takes title to the property, the assignee as lessor becomes responsible for collecting and remitting the tax.\n(c) Assignment of contract with transfer of right, title, and interst for security purposes. This type of assignment is an assignment by the lessor of the lease contract together with the transfer of the right, title, and interest in the leased property for security purposes. The assignee has recourse against the assignor. After the termination of the lease, the property usually reverts to the original lessor. The assignee, in this situation, has assumed the position of a lessor. The assignee is required to hold a Dealer\u2019s Certificate of Registration and is obligated to collect and remit the tax. The assignor is required to obtain a resale certificate from the assignee in lieu of tax.\n(d) Assignment of contract and all rights, title, and interest. This type of assignment is an assignment by the lessor of the lease contract together with the transfer of all rights, title, and interest in the leased property. The assignee has no recourse against the assignor. The assignment is not for security purposes, and the assignor does not retain any ownership rights in the contract or the property. The assignee, in this situation, has assumed the position of a lessor. The assignee is required to hold a Dealer\u2019s Certificate of Registration and is obligated to collect and remit the tax. The assignor is required to obtain a resale certificate from the assignee in lieu of tax.\nRulemaking Authority 212.18(2), 213.06(1) FS.

Therefore, this company does not qualify as an advertising agency.\n(e) \u201cAdvertising materials\u201d means tangible personal property sold to an advertising agency, created by an advertising agency, or sold by an advertising agency during the course of providing advertising services. Examples of advertising materials include: photographs, videos containing images, films containing images, veloxes, galleys, mechanicals, artwork, illustrations, digital audio tapes, analog tapes, compact discs, sketches, layouts, engravings, mats, models, mockups, and digital equipment. \u201cAdvertising materials\u201d does not include \u201craw materials.\u201d\n(f) \u201cRaw materials\u201d means materials or media used to create advertising materials. \u201cRaw materials\u201d includes items such as: blank film; blank videotapes; art supplies, such as poster board, paper products, inks, letters, and paints; stock art; stock photography; prerecorded music and sound; stock props; stock costumes; and stock backdrops.\n(g) \u201cAdvertising services\u201d means services rendered by an advertising agency when designing and/or implementing an advertising campaign to promote a product, service, idea, concept, issue, or the image of a person.

A common law principal/agent relationship is not required. The existence of a contract to act as agent for a client may be evidenced in the advertising agency\u2019s book and records by:\na. A written contract clearly stating that the advertising agency will act on behalf of a client as agent; or\nb. Documents, such as invoices and purchase orders, by which the agency discloses to its suppliers that it is acting on behalf of a client, regardless of whether the specific client(s) is identified; or\nc.

The charge by an advertising agency to clients for advertising materials is exempt from sales tax. The exemption applies regardless of the advertising agency\u2019s method of billing, whether the contract reflects a lump sum or separately states the costs of exempt advertising materials and other services and professional fees.\n2. When an advertising agency sells promotional goods along with exempt items or services, the taxable items must be separately stated in order for the exempt items to receive the exemption.\n(b) Example: The advertising agency prepares and prints a brochure for its client. The preparation of the brochure includes the concept development, design and layout, preparation of advertising materials, including photographs, artwork, and mechanicals, and the printing of the copies of the brochure. The advertising agency pays sales tax on all raw materials used in creating advertising materials. The following are examples of the proper tax treatment for each method of contracting with the charges to the client:\n1. The advertising agency contract separately itemizes the components of the brochure as: design, advertising materials, and printing. Sales tax is due only on the charge for printing, including any mark-up. The sales tax must be separately stated.\n2. The advertising agency contract combines the charges for the design services and advertising materials into a single charge, but separately states the printing charge, including the mark-up. Sales tax is due only on the charge for printing, including the mark-up. The sales tax must be separately stated.\n3. The advertising agency contract combines the charges for the design services, advertising materials, and printing in a single charge. Sales tax is due on the lump sum charge to the client. The sales tax must be separately stated.\n(4) Purchases of Advertising Materials by the Advertising Agency.\n(a) If an advertising agency is under contract to act on behalf of its clients, the advertising agency may purchase advertising materials or advertising services exempt from tax by extending an exemption certificate to the vendor. The exemption certificate does not entitle the advertising agency to purchase raw materials exempt from tax, even when those raw materials are used to produce advertising materials in-house. A suggested format of the exemption certificate to be issued to the vendor is provided in subsection (10).\n(b) Any vendor providing advertising materials to an advertising agency pursuant to this exemption is relieved of the responsibility of collecting tax on the sale of any advertising materials if:\n1. The advertising agency presents an exemption certificate certifying the agency\u2019s entitlement to the exemption to the vendor; and\n2. The vendor retains a copy of a purchaser\u2019s exemption certificate from the advertising agency in its records until tax imposed under Chapter 212, F.S., may no longer be determined and assessed under Section 95.091(3), F.S.\n(c) If it is determined that the advertising agency was not entitled to the exemption, the department shall look only to the advertising agency for any sales tax due on the purchase of advertising materials.\n(5) Creation of Advertising Materials by the Advertising Agency. If an advertising agency produces, fabricates, manufactures, or otherwise creates advertising materials in-house for its clients, the sale of such advertising materials to its clients is exempt from sales tax. Further, the advertising agency does not pay use tax on the production, fabrication, or manufacture of such advertising materials used in the performance of advertising services for its clients.\n(6) Raw Materials Used in Advertising.\n(a) The purchase of raw materials, whether purchased by an advertising agency or by a person who creates advertising materials for sale to an advertising agency, is taxable.\n(b) Example: When a photographer purchases film, the film is taxable when purchased by the photographer. However, when the photographer alters the film to create an image and sells or licenses the image to an advertising agency, the photographer does not collect tax if the advertising agency issues an exemption certificate to the photographer.\n(7) Promotional Goods.\n(a) When promotional goods are created by an advertising agency, the charge for development of", "start_char_idx": 1589554, "end_char_idx": 1593995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af9bf32a-c02c-4245-bcab-1231e34160e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "af9bf32a-c02c-4245-bcab-1231e34160e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5e2d756-96ef-4748-b91b-b235fff116ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc4365eb1edee721ce808d487d768178e2096fb6df0e9e4f15e1c6a01ee45b19"}, "3": {"node_id": "756c15ac-bf44-41dd-901c-a211a3838f75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2618b35755b88fa3603a8d89dec7630244c87be1fa8f3cd9e488fbbb3daefdc4"}}, "hash": "41e085e8f8aef61f3cbced8db83d1d964c086b0c511b0659f9b728b640288716", "text": "When promotional goods are created by an advertising agency, the charge for development of sample promotional goods is exempt from sales tax, whether produced in-house or purchased from a vendor.\n(b)1. When promotional goods are produced or reproduced for distribution, the charge for production or reproduction of the promotional goods is subject to sales tax whether or not the client takes physical possession of the promotional goods produced or reproduced for distribution. The advertising agency must register with the Department of Revenue, and collect and remit tax on the transaction. See Rule 12A-1.060, F.A.C.\n2. Example: If an advertising agency uses a printer to produce or reproduce a promotional good, such as a brochure, the advertising agency would extend an annual resale certificate (Form DR-13) to the printer, who would not charge sales tax on the invoice to the advertising agency. However, the advertising agency would be required to charge sales tax to a client for the production or reproduction costs of the promotional good, including the advertising agency\u2019s mark-up for printing. The advertising agency would remit the tax to the Department of Revenue.\n(c) For newspaper inserts, see Section 212.05(1)(g)2., F.S. For publications exempt from tax, see Section 212.08(7)(w), F.S.\n(8) Billboards. The advertising materials and services used in the creation of billboard concepts and mock-ups by an advertising agency are exempt under these provisions.

For purposes of the presumption set forth herein, it shall be necessary only that the tangible personal property was used under conditions which would allow such other state, territory of the United States, or District of Columbia to impose a sales or use tax on the sale or use of that property regardless of whether any such tax was actually imposed or paid.\n(b) The rental or lease of tangible personal property which is used or stored in this state shall be taxable without regard to its prior use or tax paid on purchase outside this state.\n(3) The provisions of the Florida Sales and Use Tax shall not apply to the use or consumption, or distribution or storage of tangible personal property for use or consumption in this state upon which a like tax equal to or greater than the amount due this state has been lawfully imposed and paid in another state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia before use tax payable to this state would otherwise have become due. If the amount of tax so lawfully imposed and paid in another state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia is not equal to or greater than the amount of tax imposed by Chapter 212, F.S., then the person from whom the use tax is due shall pay to the Department of Revenue an amount sufficient to make the tax paid in the other state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia and in this state equal to the amount imposed by that chapter.\n(4) The use tax does not apply to any property of which the retail sale is specifically exempt from payment of the Florida sales tax. The two taxes, sales and use, stand as complements to each other, and taken together provide a uniform tax upon either the sale at retail or the use of all tangible personal property irrespective of where it may have been purchased.\n(5) Every dealer who solicits business, either by direct representatives, indirect representatives or manufacturers\u2019 agents and by reason thereof receives orders for tangible personal property from consumers for use, consumption, distribution or storage for use or consumption in the state, shall collect the tax from the purchaser, and no action either in law or in", "start_char_idx": 1652323, "end_char_idx": 1656080, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c863df0-0eaf-4327-90c2-c4c2bb793d0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c863df0-0eaf-4327-90c2-c4c2bb793d0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "72311f5e-c3be-4b1a-b26f-4c8e7a1b859f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f8a4e35654d96dd018d2e025b6352304de1bafef55479cb80d6cf32448f9328"}, "3": {"node_id": "19c579c8-91ee-4838-b772-dcb1ccefdaec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6327ef14dd7d0663820d63b3d0e6070d3978f07b75c3bfd7add8e513906d9fab"}}, "hash": "07bd6e2c04e488afb0ad1b54616faddc010c25fe17883a68ec9d1f0748afb4d7", "text": "state, shall collect the tax from the purchaser, and no action either in law or in equity on a sale or transaction as provided by terms of Chapter 212, F.S., may be had in this state by any such dealer unless it is affirmatively shown that the provisions of the law have been fully complied with.\n(6) For self-accrual authorization, see Rule 12A-1.0911, F.A.C.\n(7) Under Section 212.06(1), F.S., use tax is imposed upon the cost of tangible personal property imported into this state for use, consumption, distribution, or storage for use or consumption in this state, after it has come to rest and has become a part of the general mass of property in this state, subject to the provisions contained in Rule 12A-1.045, F.A.C.\n(8) If tangible personal property is sent out of the state to be repaired and returned, the transaction is taxable.

This rule shall not apply to non-public works contracts for the repair, alteration, improvement, or construction of real property, as those contracts are governed under the provisions of Rule 12A-1.051, F.A.C. In applying this rule, the following definitions are used.\n(a)1. \u201cContractor\u201d is one that supplies and installs tangible personal property that is incorporated into or becomes a part of a public facility pursuant to a public works contract with a governmental entity exercising its authority in regard to the public property or facility. Contractors include, but are not limited to, persons engaged in building, electrical, plumbing, heating, painting, decorating, ventilating, paperhanging, sheet metal, roofing, bridge, road, waterworks, landscape, pier, or billboard work. This definition includes subcontractors.\n2. \u201cContractor\u201d does not include a person that furnishes tangible personal property that is not affixed or appended in such a manner that it is incorporated into or becomes a part of the public property or public facility to which a public works contract relates. A person that provides and installs tangible personal property that is freestanding and can be relocated with no tools, equipment, or need for adaptation for use elsewhere is not a contractor within the scope of this rule.\n3. \u201cContractor\u201d does not include a person that provides tangible personal property that will be incorporated into or become part of a public facility if such property will be installed by another party.\n4. Examples.\na. A vendor sells a desk, sofas, chairs, tables, lamps, and art prints for the reception area in a new public building. The sales agreement requires the vendor to place the furniture according to a floor plan, set up the lamps, and hang the art prints. The vendor is not a contractor within the scope of this rule, because the vendor is not installing the property being sold in such a way that it is attached or affixed to the facility.\nb. A security system vendor furnishes and installs low voltage wiring behind the walls, motion detectors, smoke alarms, other sensors, control pads, alarm sirens, and other components of a security system for a new county courthouse. The components are direct wired, fit into recesses cut into the walls or other structural elements of the building, and are held in place by screws. The vendor is a contractor within the scope of this rule. The security system is installed and affixed in such a manner that it has been incorporated into the courthouse.\nc. A vendor enters an agreement to provide and install the shelving system for a new public library. The shelves are built to bear the weight of books. The shelf configuration in each unit maximizes the number of books the shelves can hold. The number and size of the units ordered is based on the design for the library space. The units will run floor to ceiling and will be anchored in place by bolts or screws. The vendor is a contractor within the scope of this rule. The shelving system will be affixed in such a manner that it becomes a part of the public library.\nd. A vendor agrees to provide and install the computer terminals, monitors, keyboards, servers, and related equipment for a county tax collector\u2019s office in central Florida. The job includes connecting the equipment to the structural cabling system that has been installed by an electrical contractor. The cables running to the computer terminals are held in place by screws that fit into the back of the terminal units. The vendor is not a contractor within the scope of this rule.

The construction company is a contractor within the scope of this rule.\n(b) \u201cGovernmental entity\u201d includes any agency or branch of the United States government, a state, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision of a state. The term includes authorities created by statute to operate public facilities using public funds, such as public port authorities or public-use airport authorities.\n(c) \u201cPublic works\u201d are defined as projects for public use or enjoyment, financed and owned by the government, in which private persons undertake the obligation to do a specific piece of work that involves installing tangible personal property in such a manner that it becomes a part of a public facility. For purposes of this rule, a public facility includes any land, improvement to land, building, structure, or other fixed site and related infrastructure thereon owned or operated by a governmental entity where governmental or public activities are conducted. The term \u201cpublic works\u201d is not restricted to the repair, alteration, improvement, or construction of real property and fixed works, although such projects are included within the term.\n(d) \u201cReal property\u201d within the meaning of this rule includes all fixtures and improvements to real property. The status of a project as an improvement or fixture to real property will be determined by reference to the definitions contained in subsection 12A-1.051(2), F.A.C.\n(2) The purchase or manufacture of supplies or materials by a public works contractor, when such supplies or materials are purchased for the purpose of going into or becoming part of public works, whether the purchase or manufacture occurs inside or outside Florida, is taxable to the public works contractor if the public works contractor also installs such supplies or materials, since the public works contractor is the ultimate consumer of such supplies or materials. Public works contractors that purchase or manufacture such supplies and materials in Florida are liable for sales tax or use tax on such purchases and manufacturing costs. A public works contractor that purchases supplies or materials that may be sold as tangible personal property or may be incorporated into a public works project may purchase such supplies or materials without tax by issuing a copy of the contractor\u2019s Annual Resale Certificate and accrue and remit tax upon withdrawing such supplies or materials from inventory to go into or become a part of public works. Public works contractors that purchase or manufacture such materials outside the State of Florida are liable for use tax, subject to credit for any sales or use tax lawfully imposed and paid in the state of purchase or manufacture.\n(3) The purchase or manufacture of tangible personal property for resale to a governmental entity is exempt from tax, provided this exemption shall not include sales of tangible personal property made to, or the manufacture of tangible personal property by, public works contractors when such tangible personal property goes into or becomes a part of public works.\n(4)(a) The exemption in Section 212.08(6), F.S., is a general exemption for sales made directly to the government. A determination whether a particular transaction is properly characterized as an exempt sale to a governmental entity or a taxable sale to or use by a contractor shall be based on the substance of the transaction, rather than the form in which the transaction is cast. The Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee in the responsible program will determine whether the substance of a particular transaction is a taxable sale to or use by a contractor or an exempt direct sale to a governmental entity based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction as a whole.\n(b) The following criteria that govern the status of the tangible personal property prior to its affixation to real property will be considered in determining whether a governmental entity rather than a", "start_char_idx": 1679789, "end_char_idx": 1684263, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16087525-f268-4817-9b40-ad4d54bf0f26": {"__data__": {"id_": "16087525-f268-4817-9b40-ad4d54bf0f26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77f3efa9-c45b-46c0-8886-a6a81cba2d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d34b60f2db6dc677f1137a75c7fb5d8c42cc683b8110ba66152b14f448c226b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "41d2aeb5-2f95-4120-adab-1ed7c6a3a1c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4491e661e10e6b5fa8550212f3f5efa81f4a6a8b92392a1308c052d7f61b4f7e"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbf87955-393f-48de-befa-11a7d341d70d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "35b10def82deee4ee97bb065d6ad05557d881999d1cf3a4ebd433d929d9975bf"}}, "hash": "ba1183e7d483efabf08066f87018e53142f8f1d264fd7213334933bf2fad7a4e", "text": "to real property will be considered in determining whether a governmental entity rather than a contractor is the purchaser of materials:\n1.

Direct Invoice. The vendor\u2019s invoice must be issued to the governmental entity, rather than to the contractor.\n3. Direct Payment. The governmental entity must make payment directly to the vendor from public funds.\n4. Passage of Title. The governmental entity must take title to the tangible personal property from the vendor at the time of purchase or delivery by the vendor.\n5. Assumption of the Risk of Loss. Assumption of the risk of damage or loss by the governmental entity at the time of purchase is a paramount consideration. A governmental entity will be deemed to have assumed the risk of loss if the governmental entity bears the economic burden of obtaining insurance covering damage or loss or directly enjoys the economic benefit of the proceeds of such insurance.\n(c)1. To be entitled to purchase materials tax exempt for a public works project, a governmental entity is required to issue a Certificate of Entitlement to each vendor and to the governmental entity\u2019s contractor to affirm that the tangible personal property purchased from that vendor will go into or become a part of a public work. This requirement does not apply to any agency or branch of the United States government.\n2. The governmental entity\u2019s purchase order for tangible personal property to be incorporated into the public works project must be attached to the Certificate of Entitlement. The governmental entity must issue a separate Certificate of Entitlement for each purchase order. Copies of the Certificate may be issued.\n3. The governmental entity will also affirm that if the Department determines that tangible personal property sold by a vendor tax-exempt pursuant to a Certificate of Entitlement does not qualify for the exemption under Section 212.08(6), F.S. and this rule, the governmental entity will be liable for any tax, penalty, and interest determined to be due.\n4.

The term also includes a location where a portable plant is set up for a period of not less than six months in a stationary manner so as to perform the same industrial manufacturing, processing, compounding or production process that could be performed at a permanent location or plant site. The geographical limits of the fixed location for purposes of this rule are limited to the immediate permanent location or plant site. Facilities or plant units that are within the same building, or that are on the same parcel of land if not contained in a building, are considered to be one fixed location.\n(b) \u201cIndustrial machinery and equipment\u201d means tangible personal property or other property with a depreciable life of 3 years or more that is used as an integral part in the manufacturing, processing, compounding, or production of tangible personal property for sale or is exclusively used in spaceport activities. Buildings and their structural components are not industrial machinery and equipment unless the building or structural component is so closely related to the industrial machinery and equipment that it houses or supports that the building or structural component can be expected to be replaced when the machinery and equipment itself is replaced. Heating and air conditioning systems are not considered industrial machinery and equipment, unless the sole justification for their installation is to meet the requirements of the production process, even though the system may provide incidental comfort to employees, or serves, to an insubstantial degree, nonproduction activities. For example, a dehumidifier installed for the sole purpose of conditioning air in a factory, where the manufacturing of electronic components requires a controlled-humidity environment, will be considered industrial machinery and equipment. (See subsection (8) of this rule.) \n(c) \u201cIntegral to\u201d means that the machinery and equipment provides a significant function within the production process, such that the production process could not be complete without that machinery and equipment.\n(d) \u201cManufacture, process, compound, or produce for sale\u201d means the various industrial operations of a business where raw materials will be put through a series of steps to make an item of tangible personal property that will be sold. The industrial operations must bring about a change in the composition or physical nature of the raw materials. Where materials are merely repackaged or redistributed, those operations are not manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing for sale. The item of tangible personal property may be sold to another manufacturer for further processing or for inclusion as a part in another item of tangible personal property that will be sold, or the item may be sold as a finished product to a wholesaler or an end consumer. The business performing the manufacturing, processing, compounding, or production process may or may not own the raw materials.

However, the phrase \u201cmanufacture, process, compound, or produce for sale\u201d does not include fabrication, alteration, modification, cleaning, or repair services performed on items of tangible personal property belonging to others where such items of tangible personal property are not for sale.\n(e) \u201cPhysically comparable\u201d means the similarity or equivalency of the characteristics of the items of tangible personal property being manufactured, processed, compounded or produced. Physical comparability applies to the units used to measure the increase in productive output of an expanding business.\n1. Example: All models of microwave ovens made by a manufacturer, regardless of specific features, would be physically comparable. However, if the manufacturer also made coffee makers, the coffee makers would not be physically comparable to microwave ovens, even though both items are generally considered small kitchen appliances.\n2. Example: A beverage manufacturer produces a variety of soft drinks in various sized cans and bottles. The production of the various sized cans and bottles of soft drinks is not physically comparable. However, production is physically comparable when converted to a common physical unit, such as gallons of product.\n(f) \u201cProduction process\u201d or \u201cproduction line\u201d means those industrial activities beginning when raw materials are delivered to the new or expanding business\u2019 fixed location and generally ending when the items of tangible personal property have been packaged for sale, or are in saleable form if packaging is not done. However, the production process may include quality control activities after the items have been packaged (or are in salable form if packaging is normally not done), such as good manufacturing practices as mandated by the Federal Food and Drug Administration to detect adulterated food or food that has been prepared, packaged, or held under unsanitary conditions.\n1. The production process may encompass more than one fixed location if the business transfers work-in-process from one fixed location to a second fixed location for further manufacturing, processing, compounding, or production. For example, a company purchases machinery and equipment to produce raw orange juice at one fixed location, and this raw orange juice is transferred as work-in-process to a second fixed location where the company will use the raw orange juice to make five different products.\n2. A production process does not include natural processes occurring before raw material is delivered to the receiving operation or after the packaging operation. For example, the natural transformation of grass or feed into raw milk by dairy cows is not part of the production process. In this case, the production process begins with the milking parlor. The planting, growing, or harvesting of crops, and the raising of livestock or poultry are not part of the production process. The natural aging or fermentation of alcoholic beverages or other food products, after they have been packaged, is also not part of the production process. The production process ends when the alcoholic beverage or other food product has been packaged for sale.\n3. The production process does not include product design activities. For example, the computer aided design of a product where the final design program or computer file for that product will be sent to or downloaded to industrial machinery and equipment for the physical creation of the product is not a part of the production process. Similarly, the production process for printed materials does not include the initial conception or creation of the written matter. For example, the writing of a story by a reporter for subsequent printing in a newspaper is not a part of the production process. (See subsection (8) of this rule regarding machinery and equipment and the production process.)\n(g) \u201cProductive output\u201d ordinarily means the number of units actually produced by a single plant or operation in a single continuous 12-month period. The increase in productive output shall be measured by the output for 12 continuous months, as selected by the expanding business, following the completion of the installation of machinery and equipment for the expansion project as compared to the productive output of 12 continuous months immediately preceding the beginning of the installation of machinery and equipment for the expansion project.

The terms also include the acquisition of industrial machinery and equipment under a lease or rental agreement.\n(i) \u201cPurchase agreement\u201d means a document, in the form of a purchase order issued by the purchaser, a contract for purchase with a seller or vendor, a memorandum of understanding, or a lease or rental agreement with a lessor.\n(j) \u201cSpaceport activities\u201d means those activities as defined in Section 212.02, F.S.\n(2) New Business.\n(a) The purchase of industrial machinery and equipment, parts and accessories, and the installation labor thereof, is exempt from tax when purchased by a new business which uses such machinery and equipment at a fixed location in this state for exclusive use in spaceport activities, or to manufacture, process, compound, or produce items of tangible personal property for sale.\n(b) Machinery and equipment must be purchased, or purchase agreement made, before the new business begins spaceport activities or starts production, and delivery of the purchased items must be made within 12 months from the beginning of spaceport activities or the start of production.\n(c) The date of purchase of the machinery and equipment is established by the date of the purchase agreement. If no purchase agreement was made, or in the absence of proof that a purchase agreement was made prior to the determined beginning of spaceport activities or the start of production, the machinery and equipment vendor\u2019s sales invoice will be the controlling document for determining whether the machinery and equipment qualifies for the exemption. No exemption will be allowed even though delivery of machinery and equipment is made within 12 months from the beginning of spaceport activities or the start of production if the machinery and equipment was ordered after the beginning of spaceport activities or the start of production. If a purchase agreement that was made prior to the start of production is amended or changed after the start of production, any amendments or changes that increase the quantity of an item of machinery or equipment will not qualify for the exemption. Any amendments or change orders to that purchase agreement that provide for the substitution of a like kind item of machinery or equipment will qualify for the exemption.\n(d)1. The start of production is the date that a product is manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced where such product will be inventoried for sale or will be immediately sold. However, if this date does not reflect the actual start of production, the date of the start of production will be determined by the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee on a-case-by case basis. In such cases, the business is required to maintain sufficient records to enable the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee to make a proper determination as to the initial production activities of the new facility. (See subsection (6) of this rule for record keeping requirements.)\na. Initial test or trial runs necessary to calibrate or evaluate the operation of machinery and equipment, where the products made are scrapped or sold for salvage value, are not considered to be the start of production. The operation of machinery and equipment at less than full capacity, where the products made are inventoried or immediately sold, is considered to be the start of production.\nb. Production is considered to have started even though the production line may not be complete, if any part(s) of the production process is subcontracted to others and a finished product can be inventoried or immediately sold.\n2.

(See subsection (6) of this rule for record keeping requirements.)\n(e) The Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee will determine if a business qualifies for exemption as a new business, based on the facts in each particular case.\n1. A new business means a newly-formed company that opens a facility or plant, at a fixed location in this state, to manufacture, process, compound, or produce items of tangible personal property for sale, or to exclusively use industrial machinery and equipment in spaceport activities.\n2. A new business means an addition to, or the enlargement of, an existing facility or plant, or the installation of additional machinery and equipment, for the purpose of manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing items of tangible personal property for sale that represent a distinct and separate economic activity from other items that have been or are being produced at that same fixed location, or to exclusively use industrial machinery and equipment in distinct and separate spaceport activities. For example, a company that currently manufactures washing machines would be considered a new business for the purpose of installing a dedicated assembly line for the manufacturing of refrigerators. A new business does not mean an addition to, or the enlargement of, an existing facility or plant, or the installation of additional machinery and equipment at an existing facility or plant, for the purpose of manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing component parts that were previously purchased from, or fabricated by, outside sources for inclusion in that business\u2019 finished items of tangible personal property for sale. (See subsection (4) of this rule regarding manufacturing business classification factors.)\n3. A new business means opening a new facility or plant, at a fixed location in this state, to manufacture, process, compound, or produce an item of tangible personal property for sale, or to exclusively use industrial machinery and equipment in spaceport activities, provided no other facility or plant in this state that manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced the same or a similar item of tangible personal property, or performed the same or a similar spaceport activity, at a fixed location in this state, was closed to open the new facility or plant, or will be closed within 12 months. However, this limitation concerning the closure of a facility or plant is not applicable to a mining activity when a mine is closed due to the exhaustion or depletion of the mined resource such that mining is no longer economically feasible at that location.\n4. A new business does not mean the change of ownership of an existing facility or plant, at a fixed location in this state, that manufactures, processes, compounds, or produces items of tangible personal property for sale, or exclusively uses industrial machinery and equipment in spaceport activities, by a purchase arrangement, merger, or some other similar means, unless such facility or plant ceased doing productive operations for a period of not less than 12 months.\n(3) Expanding Business.\n(a) The purchase of industrial machinery and equipment, parts and accessories, and the installation thereof, is exempt from tax when purchased by an expanding business that uses such machinery and equipment at a fixed location in this state to increase the productive output of tangible personal property that is manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced for sale by not less than 5 percent, or for exclusive use in spaceport activities.\n(b) The Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee will determine whether a business qualifies for exemption as an expanding business, based upon the facts of each case using the following guidelines:\n1.a.

An expanding business means an addition to, or the modernization or enlargement of, an existing facility or the installation of additional machinery and equipment to begin manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing a component item of tangible personal property that will be incorporated into a finished item of tangible personal property for sale that is already being produced at that fixed location. When the component item of tangible personal property is manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced, the completion of the first component item meets the required productive output increase. When the business manufactures, processes, compounds, or produces that component for sale to others and incorporates that component in other items of tangible personal property for sale, the business would be classified as a new business.\nc. For example, a washing machine manufacturer that previously purchased water pumps from an outside supplier as component parts for the washing machines would be considered an expanding business, rather than a new business, when it purchases machinery and equipment to begin manufacturing its own component water pumps and does not offer the water pumps for sale to others. When the first component water pump is produced, the manufacturer, as an expanding business, meets the required productive output increase.\nd. An expanding business means an addition to, or the modernization or enlargement of, an existing facility or the installation of additional machinery and equipment to perform a spaceport activity that is already being performed, or is similar to an activity that is already being performed, at that fixed location.\n2. An expanding business means closing an existing plant or an operation in a plant in this state and moving it to a new location in this state within 12 months of the closing.\n3. An expanding business means the purchase of an existing facility to manufacture, process, compound, or produce an item of tangible personal property that is already being produced at that facility or is similar to an item of tangible personal property that is already being produced at that facility.\n(c)1. To qualify for exemption as an expanding business, the taxpayer is required to provide information to the satisfaction of the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee that the items purchased will be or have been used to increase the productive output of the existing facility or specific product line(s) by not less than 5 percent. An expanding business is allowed to specify whether the 5 percent increase in productive output is for the entire plant or for specific product line(s). However, where the increase in productive output applies to a product or component that becomes part of different product lines, the increase in productive output will be determined by measuring the increase in the combined output of the different product lines. Similarly, if the additional machinery and equipment affects the productive output of more than one product line, the increase in productive output must be measured by all of the product lines that have been affected.\na. Example: If a company purchases machinery and equipment that increases its production of raw orange juice by 25 percent, and this raw orange juice is used by the company to make five different products, the increase in productive output would be determined by measuring the volume increase in the combined output of all five different products.\nb. Example: A beverage manufacturer that currently produces a variety of soft drinks in 12-ounce cans purchases machinery and equipment to begin making plastic bottles and also purchases additional mixing machinery and equipment to make more syrup for overall beverage production. Effectively, there are two separate expansion projects for this manufacturer. The plastic bottle expansion project will meet the required productive output increase requirement upon production of the first bottle. However, the productive output increase requirement for the additional mixing machinery and equipment must be measured by the amount of beverages produced at the plant.\nc.

The productive output increase may be measured just on the production of coffeemakers.\n2. The physical productive output measurement must be based on physical production data, which is directly relevant to the business and/or the product(s) being produced. A physical productive output measurement based on indirect or minor, variable components is not a relevant measurement. For example, a relevant measurement for a furniture manufacturer would be the number of pieces of furniture manufactured, not the amount of glue, paint, stain, or varnish used in the manufacturing of furniture.\n3. Expanding spaceport activities are not subject to the increase in productive output requirement.\n(4) Manufacturing Business Classification Factors.\n(a) When an additional product is made at an existing fixed location, the determination whether that business is classified for the exemption as a new business or as an expanding business will depend upon whether the additional product represents an economic activity that is distinct and separate from a product, or a group of products, that is already being manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced at that fixed location.\n(b) The Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee will make a determination regarding the classification of a business\u2019 application for exemption on a case-by-case basis. The Department will be guided by the following factors when making a determination:\n1. The general nature of the applicant\u2019s predominant existing business;\n2. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry number of the existing product(s) versus the additional product;\n3. The raw materials or components used to make the existing product(s) versus the additional product;\n4. Whether the additional product is an alternative to, or represents a replacement for, the existing product(s);\n5. The differences in machinery and equipment needed to make the existing product(s) versus the additional product; and\n6. The units used to measure production of the existing product(s) versus the additional product.\n(c) No single factor within paragraph (b) will decide whether the additional product represents a distinct and separate economic activity.\n(d) Additional products that merely differ in size, color, flavor, style, packaging, or model line, or existing products that merely incorporate newer technology, are not considered to be a distinct and separate economic activity. For example, the manufacturing of electronic products based on digital technology is not a distinct and separate economic activity from the manufacturing of electronic products based on analog technology.\n(e) The business claiming an exemption as a new business has the burden of demonstrating that the additional product represents a distinct and separate economic activity from a product, or group of products, that is already being manufactured, processed, compounded, or produced at the fixed location.\n(5) Temporary Tax Exemption Permit \u2013 Refund or Credit.\n(a) To receive the exemption provided under subsection (2) or (3), a qualifying business entity must apply to the Florida Department of Revenue, Technical Assistance and Dispute Resolution, Post Office Box 7443, Tallahassee, Florida 32314-7443, for a temporary tax exemption permit. The business entity seeking a temporary tax exemption must file an Application for Temporary Tax Exemption Permit (Form DR-1214) with the Department prior to receiving a permit or refund for the new or expanded business. Upon a tentative affirmative determination of the business\u2019s qualification for exemption by the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee, a temporary tax exemption permit will be issued to, or a refund authorized for, the business entity.\n(b)1. A temporary tax exemption permit may be issued only to the qualified business entity which will use the qualifying machinery and equipment at a fixed location in this state in manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing tangible personal property for sale, or for exclusive use in spaceport activities.

The business entity that extends the temporary tax exemption permit to a contractor or subcontractor for the purpose of authorizing that contractor or subcontractor to purchase qualifying machinery and equipment tax exempt will be responsible for paying the sales and use tax on any nonqualified items purchased tax exempt by the contractor or subcontractor.\n2. Upon completion of purchases of qualifying machinery and equipment, the temporary tax exemption permit is required to be delivered to the Department or returned by certified or registered mail. If the permit is returned by mail, the permit should be mailed to the Florida Department of Revenue, Technical Assistance and Dispute Resolution, P.O. Box 7443, Tallahassee, Florida 32314-7443.\n(c)1. If a qualifying business entity fails to apply for a temporary tax exemption permit before purchasing qualifying machinery and equipment for a new or expanded business, or if the initial determination by the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee is negative, the exemptions provided by subsections (2) and (3) above may be obtained only by a refund to the business entity of previously paid taxes. Refunds will not be allowed until information has been provided to the satisfaction of the Executive Director or the Executive Director\u2019s designee that such machinery and equipment meets the requirements of this rule and is used as designated herein. Only the qualified business entity that will use the qualifying machinery and equipment at a fixed location in this state in manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing tangible personal property for sale, or for exclusive use in spaceport activities is entitled to request a refund of sales or use taxes paid on qualifying industrial machinery and equipment, or installation thereof. \n2. Before the owners of a qualifying new or expanded business under subsection (2) or (3) may request a refund of sales or use taxes paid by their contractors on qualifying industrial machinery and equipment, or installation thereof, the following certified statement(s) must be executed:\na. If a subcontractor was involved, the subcontractor must obtain a certified statement from its supplier(s) or other subcontractor(s) certifying that the supplier or other subcontractor has remitted the tax to the State, or certifying that the subcontractor has remitted use tax directly to the State. The subcontractor must then extend the statement(s) it has executed or obtained from suppliers or other subcontractors to the prime contractor; and\nb. The prime contractor must obtain a certified statement from its supplier(s) and subcontractor(s) certifying that the supplier or subcontractor has remitted the tax to the State, or certifying that the prime contractor has remitted use tax directly to the State. The prime contractor must then extend the statement(s) it has executed or obtained from its supplier(s) or subcontractor(s) to the qualifying new or expanded business entity to support the refund claim.\n(d)1.

However, documentation that the tax has been remitted to the State of Florida in a timely manner is required.\n(e) The right to a refund of, or credit for, sales or use taxes.\nl. An application for refund by a new business must be filed within 3 years after the date the tax was paid in accordance with the timing provisions of Section 215.26(2), F.S. However, an application for refund will not be considered complete pursuant to Sections 213.255(2) and (3), F.S., and Rule 12-26.003, F.A.C., and a refund will not be approved, before the date the new business first places a product in inventory or immediately sells a product, or before the date a new business engaged in spaceport activities begins those activities.\n2. An application for refund by an expanding business must be filed within 3 years after the date the tax was paid in accordance with the timing provisions of Section 215.26(2), F.S. However, an application for refund will not be considered complete pursuant to Sections 213.255(2) and (3), F.S., and Rule 12-26.003, F.A.C., and a refund will not be approved, before the date an expanding business can substantiate that the business expansion has increased the productive output at the existing facility by not less than 5 percent, or for an expanding business engaged in spaceport activities, before the date of completion of the installation of the machinery and equipment.\n(6) Record Keeping Requirements. The applicant is required to maintain all necessary books and records to support the exemption. All such books, invoices, certified statements, and other records must be open for inspection by the Department at all reasonable hours at the qualifying business entity\u2019s location in this state. Any qualifying business entity that maintains such books and records at a point outside this state is required to make such books and records available for inspection by the Department where the general records are kept.\n(7) Exclusions.\n(a) The exemptions provided by subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to machinery and equipment purchased or used by electric utility companies; communication companies; oil or gas exploration or production operations; publishing firms that do not export at least 50 percent of their finished product out of the state; any firm subject to regulation by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation; or any firm which does not manufacture, process, compound, or produce items of tangible personal property for sale, or exclusively use machinery and equipment in spaceport activities.\n(b) If a publishing firm is also the printer of the finished product, the Department will consider the business to be a printer for the purpose of the exemption. Therefore, the above indicated 50 percent requirement would not apply to such a business.\n(8) Types of industrial machinery and equipment that will or will not qualify for the exemption.\n(a) For the purpose of this exemption, industrial machinery and equipment includes:\n1. Special foundations required for the support of such qualifying machinery and equipment;\n2. Electrical wiring from the nearest power panel or disconnect box to the qualifying machinery and equipment; and,\n3. Plumbing connections necessary to connect the machinery and equipment to the nearest water supply or drain line.\n(b) The exemption for industrial machinery and equipment ends at that stage of the production process where the product produced is placed in a package (or is in salable form if packaging is normally not done) to be sold to the wholesaler, retailer, or other purchaser.

The effective Address/Jurisdiction Database is available for downloading and does not include the information contained in the pending files described in subparagraph (1)(b)1.\n1. When a change to the Address/Jurisdiction Database has been approved, the approved pending address additions and approved pending address deletions are stored in separate files until they are included in the next scheduled update of the database. These pending files include all changes since the most recent update, including changes to jurisdictional boundaries.\n2. The single address lookup feature permits any person to enter an address to identify the county to which it is assigned. The individual address lookup feature in the electronic database searches within the current database, as well as the pending files, and may reflect information not yet incorporated into the database available for download. In such cases, the individual address lookup page displays a statement indicating the page reflects a pending change to the database.\n3. Each update of the Address/Jurisdiction Database is posted on the Department\u2019s website at least 90 days prior to publication and is also available for download. The updated Address/Jurisdiction Database incorporates the corrections of any errors discovered since the previous update, as well as changes in addresses or county assignments based on information provided by counties. \n(c) To fulfill its statutory responsibility to maintain the database, when the Department notices apparent errors, the Department will initiate an objection to the database in accordance with the provisions of subsection (4) and will process the objection in the same manner in which other objections are processed.\n(2) Updating Florida\u2019s Address/Jurisdiction Database.\n(a) Counties contribute to maintaining the Address/Jurisdiction Database by providing the Department with updated information, such as changes in addresses or address ranges along with the county assignment and any other changes, using Form DR-700022, Notification of Changes to the Address/Jurisdiction Database (incorporated by reference in Rule 12A-19.100, F.A.C.). Counties must provide to the Department the names of the county officers or employees authorized to act as contact persons regarding database matters. Counties may provide updated contact information as frequently as necessary to ensure that the appropriate contact person can be reached regarding database matters. \n(b) Counties may submit a change request to the Address/Jurisdiction Database electronically, using instructions in Form DR-700002, User\u2019s Guide for the Address/Jurisdiction Database (incorporated by reference in Rule 12A-19.071, F.A.C.), available at pointmatch.floridarevenue.com. Any requested changes or additions to the Address/Jurisdiction Database must be supported by competent evidence as outlined in subsection (3).\n(c) If a county does not have address updates, the county may indicate no changes by submitting Form DR-700023, Notification of No Change to the Address/Jurisdiction Database for Sales and Use Tax, effective 8/20; hereby incorporated by reference (http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-13413); copies of this form can be downloaded from the Department\u2019s website at floridarevenue.com/forms.\n(d)1. The county must specify the effective date, either January 1 or July 1, of any information to be incorporated in the Address/Jurisdiction Database. For a January 1 effective date, changes must be submitted no later than September 3, and for a July 1 effective date, changes must be submitted no later than March 3. \n2. Counties may not submit changes between September 4 to October 3 and March 4 to April 2. The Department completes its review of pending submissions for the next database update during these periods and is unable to process new submissions. Submissions of new information during these time periods will be denied and must be submitted after the review period. \n3.

Examples of competent evidence include articles of incorporation of a new municipality, the plat filed for a newly approved subdivision, or the enhanced 911 Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) database information relating to local law enforcement responders. Competent evidence must clearly identify the affected addresses or address ranges.\n(b) If a requested change is to move an address from one county or jurisdiction to another county or jurisdiction, competent evidence includes the consent of the county or jurisdiction that did not request the change. \n1. To facilitate processing the change, the county requesting the change should attempt to obtain written consent from an authorized contact person of the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction. Form DR-700022 contains an authorization statement that will serve as the written consent of the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction when signed by that county\u2019s or jurisdiction\u2019s authorized contact person. The Department will consider the receipt of Form DR-700022, containing the signatures of both authorized contact persons of the requesting and nonrequesting county or jurisdiction, to be sufficient competent evidence. In such instances, the Department will make the change based upon the submitted form. \n2. If the requesting county or jurisdiction has not obtained the written consent of the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction, the Department will contact the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction before making the change. Based upon the response of the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction, the Department will take one of the following actions in regard to the requested change:\na. If the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction provides written consent to the Department, then the Department will process the change.\nb. If the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction objects in writing, the Department will treat the requested change as one that must be resolved by the counties and jurisdictions involved as provided in paragraph (4)(d).\nc. If the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction fails to either consent or object in writing within 20 days after the date on which the Department notified that county or jurisdiction of the requested change, the Department will accept and process the change. This will not prevent the nonrequesting county or jurisdiction from subsequently submitting requests to change the new address assignments after they have been processed.\n3. A county or jurisdiction that objects to proposed changes should use Form DR-700022 to change the address information and, unless the affected county or jurisdiction signs the form, the Department will treat the request as one that must be resolved by the counties involved as provided in paragraph (4)(d).\n(c) If a requested change affects only the requesting county and does not affect another county or jurisdiction, the Department will consider receipt of an affidavit signed by the authorized contact person, identifying the addresses or address ranges and stating that the change affects only the requesting county, to be sufficient competent evidence. The use of an affidavit is not required but, at the option of the requesting county or jurisdiction, may be used instead of providing other documentation. In such instances, the Department will make the change based upon the representations on the form and the affidavit. \n(d) Example. A county approves the plat and grants the permits necessary for development of a new outdoor mall on February 1, 2021. The plat indicates street names, but address numbers have not yet been assigned. In order for the addresses to be added to the electronic database effective the following July 1, the county must file Form DR-700022 with a copy of the approved outdoor mall plat or an affidavit indicating that the change affects only the requesting county and submit online address change information by March 3, 2021. If that deadline is not met, the earliest date on which the new service addresses can be added to the database is January 1, 2022.

Examples of substantially affected parties include individuals who purchase taxable items and pay local discretionary sales surtax, dealers who are required to collect sales tax and surtax, dealers who are required to collect tourist development taxes, and the Department of Revenue.\n1. Only objections to the effective Address/Jurisdiction Database will be considered; objections to the pending Address/Jurisdiction Database will be denied. \n2. Before submitting an objection, a person should check the effective Address/Jurisdiction Database to determine whether the contemplated objection is necessary. \n(b) Examples of competent evidence are stated in paragraph (3)(a). The Department will notify the substantially affected party of any deficiencies in the objection or competent evidence.\n(c) When the Department believes that addresses or address ranges have been assigned to an incorrect county or jurisdiction, the Department will initiate the change by using Form DR-700025. The Department will use any information at its disposal, including enhanced 911 MSAG database address information and information supplied by any dealer, as a basis for initiating an objection; however, in no event will the Department change any address assignment without providing notice to the affected counties and jurisdictions in the manner provided in paragraph (3)(b). If the change is approved, it will be included in the pending files with other approved changes for inclusion in the next update of the database.\n(d) Upon receipt of a completed Form DR-700025, including competent evidence to support the objection, the Department will forward copies of the form, along with the associated documentation, to the database contact person in each affected county or jurisdiction. \n1. The Department will provide Form DR-700026, Local Government Authorization for Address Changes Described on Form DR-700025 (incorporated by reference in Rule 12A-19.100, F.A.C.), so the affected counties or jurisdictions may agree, disagree, or partially agree with the address county changes proposed by the completed Form DR-700025. \n2. The Department will provide Form DR-700027, Local Government Authorization for Omission of Address or Incorrect Address Identification (incorporated by reference in Rule 12A-19.100, F.A.C.), so the affected counties or jurisdictions may agree or disagree with the inclusion of an address or address range or with changing nonjurisdictional information about an address or address range proposed by the completed Form DR-700025. \n3. In case the forms become separated, the Department will include on the bottom portion of each form the same tracking number and date to identify which forms belong together. The Department will, when practicable, provide the information electronically for review by the counties or jurisdictions. These forms will not be sent to the counties or jurisdictions between February 1 and April 2 or between August 4 and October 3 due to the inability of counties or jurisdictions to make online changes during the updating and posting of the next effective Address/Jurisdiction Database. \n4. The counties or jurisdictions should review the specific address(es) at issue as well as the address range(s) that will be impacted by the change to ensure that each county or jurisdiction retains all of the addresses it believes are within its county or jurisdictional boundaries. \n5.
